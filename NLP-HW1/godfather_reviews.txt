From lavish weddings to ceremonial baptisms, the Corleone's live the American Dream; one cannoli at a time.I had never seen The Godfather until today.

22 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Maybe it's because I recently watched Part 3 but this viewing the entire thing felt so much more tragic. I mean, sure, Michael becomes a cool mob boss who crushes his enemies but he dooms himself to an existence where he's going to lose everyone close to him. Anyway this movie rules. Every scene is great, every role perfectly cast. Great work, Francis.  
23 This was my first viewing ever of The Godfather. I'm sorry everyone. Forgive me. This is the most overrated film I've ever seen to date. However, the acting was outstanding. I loved Marlon Brando in particular. It really frustrates me that I wasn't crazy about this. 
24 the main reason this is considered one, if not the best, film ever it's because how hot Al Pacino looked 
25 This may not be your ordinary family, but they provide enough thrills, laughs, and yes heart, that this sorely needed beacon of hope is exactly what we need right now. The real "offer we can't refuse" is that we all deserve empathy and kindness, which may be the most "Sicilian" message of all in these times.

44 i love italians i wish they were real 
45  I hope everyone had a wonderful Thanksgiving!It doesn't get any better than this folks. Every Thanksgiving I watch four films that revolve around the life of the mafia, gangsters, that sort of thing. No matter if I throw in a new film or not, the first two Godfather films are always cemented in my marathon. Simply put, The Godfather is perfect. No film, except it's sequel, has come close to the level of cinematic nirvana that Coppola's work achieves.‚Ä¶  
46 There should be a warning on the blu ray or something... It's a fucking Christmas movie. Don't watch it in August! 
47 bitches complain about the godfather being too long and then go and binge watch 7 episodes of a tv show... it's me, i'm bitches 
48  100"In looking at The Godfather as a whole, I simply fall into its rhythms and then three hours pass by, waking up as if in a stupor. It has the immense capacity of feeling as if this stretch of continuity is liquid ‚Äì flowing by like a river. And yet, The Godfather is a section of a life lived, a rise and a fall, and its ultimate accomplishment is condensing it into an easy-going popular entertainment that still shocks‚Ä¶  
49 this is a pretty small indie movie idk if any of u will have heard of it but u should check it out i thought it was really good üôà 
50 whatever. Overrated as hell 
51  Immortal for its contribution to cinema & one of the prime examples of filmmaking art, The Godfather is a remarkable inside-out look at the life of a mafia family that also paints an astounding portrait of organised crime. Scoring full marks in all aspects of filmmaking, be it direction, screenplay, acting, cinematography, editing or music, this crime drama immerses viewers into its world from the very beginning and narrates its story with such strong magnetic grip for the next three hours‚Ä¶  
52 I worked as a camera guy on this film. Martin didn't listen to my complaints that we needed to go talk to George Lucas and get Qui Gon in the film. This film, while very good, lacks Qui Gon, which ties the plot together in ways that only Martin and myself knew. 0.5/10He should have listened and put Lego Qui Gon in it.

70  I know people love this movie, but I am very close to hating it.This was my 2nd time watching the film to completion and I think I should get a medal for it. Three long hours of boredom, no characters I can connect with or care about, and a plot that offers the occasional interesting moment but is mostly just people mumbling about how they want to kill other people. If I'm going to spend this much time invested‚Ä¶  
71  During the summer of 1999, I worked part time at the local library, a minimum wage, 12 hours a week gig during high school to get some extra cash to waste.

During my brief tenure in that position, my film universe exploded from what‚Ä¶

73  üèÜ98%To not call this film a masterpiece would compromise my own integrity, because I truly believe it is as good as everyone says. This is my first time watching The Godfather in several years, and it has only gotten better with age. Being someone who appreciates the subtleties just a bit more (now) allow me to respect what Coppola was going for even more so. The direction is absolutely brilliant. You may ask yourself; ‚Äúwhy is he docking 2%?‚Äù‚Ä¶  
74 Simply the best Godfather, apart from the other two which are just as good.

77  The Godfather is inserted, in its own way, in that nostalgic vein widely frequented by New Hollywood filmmakers, within which the classic genres are reworked and revitalized, according to a very explicit language, distant from previous stylistic and content conventions. The subject - the world of immigrants dedicated to crime - has in fact already been the basis of many films in the past, but thanks to the extraordinary talent of Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo, and the superproduction‚Ä¶

86 A friend should always underestimate your virtues and an enemy overestimate your faults.I think objectively, this might be the greatest film ever made. Cappola crafts his vision perfectly and you see it from the all-time story telling, the gorgeous cinematography, a captivating score and generational castings (what Al Pacino and Marlo Brando do here is beyond incredible). Its the perfect crime-gangster drama, my favourite one ever, and is likely the most influential/quotable one to exist.Probably has my favourite movie character ever in Michael Corleone, seeing his transition come full circle during the baptism scene is an experience you cant really forget. A masterpiece.

90 Just watched The Offer on¬†Paramount+ and couldn't help but be reminded of this movie. 
91 The Godfather ¬†more like The Good Movie 
92  While I'd still choose the second film by a landslide, Pauline Kael's assertion of this being a perfect merger of commerce and art is absolutely correct - this is arguably the blueprint for the ideal form of popular narrative cinema. Structurally magnificent - constantly astonishing in how the film doesn't follow A-B plot mechanics at all (if not traditional plot devices period) and is actually almost devoid of subtext: two things we're often told (whether it be teachers or producers)‚Ä¶  
93 not that good tbh, i almost threw up this was so bad 
94  I just love how Brando is the star of the poster and most memorable character of this first entry... yet, he barely shows up for less than 15 mins or so.Started the new year with a fang and ending it with a bang (ahhh see what I did there?) - this is the epithome of family drama and gangster movies, and whoever says otherwise, well, in The Dude's own word: "Yeah, well, that's like your opinion man..."What can‚Ä¶  
95 couldn't be more ashamed of the four-and-a-half stars I gave this film last year 
96  behind the endless myth of this epos of grandeur lies the story why it has become what it has become - a first class cultural artifact. cause behind the family, the festivities, the constellations. behind operations, directives, commands. behind the procedures, routines, collocations. behind bargains, shootouts, killings. behind stuffed chin Brando, Pacinos eyes glancing into the abyss and sundry genre and non genre farrago, there is this crucial point - and it becomes clear only with the final image:paternalism‚Ä¶

123 Good concept, but it seems like a lot of the story is copied from the movie Shark Tales.

124  Absolute CapitalismThe Godfather is the defining movie of cinemas golden decade, the 1970's. It is admired by arthouse critics and still continues to influence media and culture due to its iconography and appeal to those who seek entertainment as well as the beard stroking intellectual.

(I'm revisiting the first two films as prep for another look at Godfather III, which I honestly haven't even thought about since its original theatrical release.) Basically perfect all the way through the Sollozzo/McCluskey hit, precisely 90 minutes in; second half's "merely" great, with the chronology becoming more diffuse (years suddenly start elapsing between scenes) and the tension necessarily going comparatively slack while Michael's stuck wooing a child in Sicily.

137  I've just witnessed cinematic perfection.Now, I'm only a budding cinephile, but I'll say this nevertheless: few films can come close to The Godfather in terms of storytelling, cinematography, thematic value, direction, and of course, acting. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen until the credits began to roll.The technical brilliance of the film is apparent in the 40s and 50s aesthetic, in the way Francis Ford Coppola sets us up to understand the true power of the‚Ä¶

140 Having a film day with my friend, and this was his first time watching The Godfather. I hadn‚Äôt seen it in years. This rewatch reminded me how it truly is one of the all-time great movies for a reason. Every scene is iconic, it‚Äôs filled with quotable moments and the three hour runtime flies by. It‚Äôs the quintessential crime drama mobster epic. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna make him an offer he can‚Äôt refuse.‚Äù

Every inch of minute details circles back in the end. Each seemingly minor character plays an important role in the grand scheme of things. There‚Äôs an indescribably intelligent choice to exclusively show mob on mob violence, allowing for us to actually care for these awful humans. The pathos brought‚Ä¶  
143 I‚Äôm sorry but it really is the best movie ever made. I'm ¬†gonna start thanking Francis before every meal every day from now on for fighting to get Al Pacino in it, call me old fashioned but I was raised to serve my man Michael Corleone etc etc. Tears running down my face as i select the "in theaters" tag, feeling blessed. End of tweet. 
144  The godfatherNunca me imagin√© que la primera vez que ver√≠a El Padrino ser√≠a en una pantalla grande y pues por azares del destino se dio. Para conmemorar los 50 a√±os de su estreno algunos cines de mi pa√≠s la proyectaron y no me pod√≠a perder esta oportunidad √∫nica.¬†The Godfather rebas√≥ mis expectativas, su alargada duraci√≥n de casi tres horas se pasan como si nada, es una cinta que ni te deja respirar, literalmente me aguante todo ese rato‚Ä¶  
145 Hypermasculine in a way I don‚Äôt care for, but I am quite fascinated by Pacino‚Äôs performance and his feminine nature that contrasts this. The descent of Michael Corleone is magnified by the loss of this feminine side. We watch as it slowly gets more and more consumed by this hypermasculine world. 
146 not that good. no meth, no rv, no los pollos hermanos, no sigmas, no walter jr, no Better Call Saul commercials, no kid named finger, no DEA, no chemistry. 
147 I fear I may have girlbossed a bit too close to the sun by watching this 
148 Es realmente inentendible que uno pueda ir y sacar una entrada para ver esto. No tiene sentido. Insuperable, lo m√°s grande que me pas√≥ en un cine. 
149 i love being a film bro 
150  Primarily set in the heart of New York City, Coppola's 'The Godfather' is a road trip of sorts that peruses along a coast created by loyalty, maintained by trust, and threatened by the bubbling discourse of revenge and suspicion. Outdone in spirit by the charismatically authoritative appeal of Marlon Brando - it is through Pacino that Michael's evolution as a character reaches beyond his tailor-made bravado. Eyes glazed with emotion - albeit pride, hesitation, or begrudged madness - his silence‚Ä¶  
151  Godfather is a remarkable Masterpiece in filmmaking; based on the novel of the same name by Mario Puzo, it tells the story of an Italian-American patriarch Corleone family, who are highly powerful and influential in the mafia underworld. The first part is about the rise of Michael Corleone, the youngest son of Don Vito Corleone, who takes charge of his father‚Äôs throne reluctantly after the increase of rivalries and assassination attempt on his father. The movie is outstanding in every‚Ä¶  
152 Two things:Who in the right mind would choose Fredo to be their bodyguard?If you tell Sollozzo you want to meet somewhere public to feel safe, why would you agree to drive with just him and a corrupt police captain in a car without any protection, where they could have easily killed you? 
153 Watched in theaters. Fucking magnificent. Wish I was eating a big bowl of spaghetti and meatballs while watching it but I had to settle for popcorn and orange vanilla flavored coke. Either way, excellent in every way. 
154  The Godfather is so omnipresent in American culture. I‚Äôve seen it several times through the years, but sometimes I forget it even exists. It‚Äôs been at least a decade since I‚Äôve seen it, so I decided to make Amazon Video an offer it couldn‚Äôt refuse. Two ninety-nine for a forty-eight hour rental, to be exact.In a two hour and fifty-five minute film, not one moment is wasted. Every charged reaction and tense gesture tells us who Sonny is, and‚Ä¶  
155 As good a mafia movie as I‚Äôve seen. If I‚Äôm honest the whole mafia/crime theme is not my thing. I was also hesitant at just how long this movie was. I‚Äôm glad I watched it though. It‚Äôs beautiful and deserved all the acclaim it‚Äôs received. Filled with classic and memorable scenes. What an iconic performance from Marlon Brando. Al Pacino was also superb. Would have been an amazing spectacle to have see this on the big screen in the 70‚Äôs. 
156  There's so many perfectly executed scenes through The Godfather that it can be easy to underrate how nicely shaped the movie is, sometimes too overblown in that Coppola manner, but the transition between generations and with that capitalist periods is achieved with precision.The movie is at its best when it goes all in its notions of tribalism and how they contrast with Pacino's Michael, for whom so much of it is mere an easy excuse; his disconnect from his‚Ä¶  
157  Yeah you know...I hadn‚Äôt actually seen this in its entirety before tonight so good for me for finally doing it! And of course it was amazing and captivating and wonderful in spite of the 3 hour run time! I mean, I‚Äôm really not your guy for opinions on non-horror films, but I still say this was great! Who knew Al Pacino was such a looker when he was young? Not me!My mom couldn‚Äôt believe I hadn‚Äôt seen this before‚Ä¶  
158  Is the Godfather really that good? (Spoiler alert yes it really fucking is)The Godfather follows the trials and tribulations of the inner life and professional life of the Italian-American Corleone crime family.¬†My first time rewatching the ‚Äúbest film of all time‚Äù and I will admit my first reaction of The Godfather was a positive one but not one of absolute awe, the kind you would expect of this masterpiece. But never fear, I now am in absolute awe‚Ä¶  
159 From the first 5 minute alone, Marlon Brando‚Äôs performance as Don Vito Corleone hooked me in. Everything you‚Äôve ever heard about Godfather is true. It‚Äôs a somber, slow look into the passing the torch of generations in the mob. Brando‚Äôs amazing, but what really surprised me was how little he was actually used. The film is really about Michael Corleone‚Äôs progression from Army man who wants nothing to do with the family business to becoming to new Don through circumstances bigger than himself, all captured well through Al Pacino‚Äôs amazing performance. So yeah, Godfather is one the greatest movies ever made. Hats off to you Coppola. 
160 I swear i‚Äôm probably just an insane pessimist but this was way more tame then I was expecting it to be üò≠, ¬†idk this movie has like so much hype and then watching it, it‚Äôs like oh cool that one pop culture reference and then it‚Äôs kind of just a boring 1st and 2nd act until the third which is just wonderful ü§≠ but yeah idk if I dig this film as much as other people 
161  ‚ÄùJust wasn‚Äôt enough time, Michael. Just wasn‚Äôt enough time.‚ÄùAs far back as I can remember, I‚Äôve been watching and rewatching The Godfather. There‚Äôs not a feeling about this movie I haven‚Äôt had, or an opinion I haven‚Äôt shared, forgotten, and then mistakenly remembered as something new.Like a lot of movie fans I measure the passage of time through cinema. I remember years because of their release schedules; certain films have become paired with distinct periods in my life‚Ä¶  
162  I was 12 the first time I watched this, we had moved to Bangkok for my father's job, my parents were on the verge of separating because of a laundry list of issues but one of my fondest memories from our 4 month stay in Thailand is from one of the nights when The Godfather started playing on TV ‚Äî my dad got visibly excited: "Bardi, come watch this! You are gonna love it!"... my mom got upset, she didn't‚Ä¶

165  Anhand jeder einzelnen Szenen dieses Epos erkenne ich an, wieso The Godfather als Meisterwerk der Filmkunst gilt. Die ausladenden Sets, die knisternde Atmosph√§re, die spitzfindigen Dialoge und die schroffen Gewalteskalationen. Dazu die Zwischent√∂ne, Schicksale und der durchdachte Aufbau.All das erkenne ich und konnte ich sch√§tzen. Aber mein Film ist The Godfather nicht und das liegt an seiner Thematik. Ich werde in diesem Leben kein Fan mehr von Mafia-Filmen. Mich interessiert das Genre einfach zu wenig als das ich mich‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs kind of incredible that everything on the list that I watched (the top 5) all ended up getting 5 star ratings out of me. These are all movies with 4.4 average ratings or above, so I expected each of them to be unforgettable experiences,‚Ä¶  
167 I've owned this movie on Blu-Ray for about a year but i've been too scared to watch it. There is so much hype on this movie I felt like it would be impossible to match my expectations. After watching it I can safetly say I was still amazed at how fucking great this film is. There's nothing I can add here that hasn't been said before about this masterpiece besides this: On to Part II.

170 What can I say, it‚Äôs one of the best filled with the best. 
171  First of all, i'm so sorry if i put this for so long i know I'm such a dumbass. I seriously thought this was just another filmbro film. But boy i was wrong. Truthfully this has lived up to it's high reputation and absolutely deserve the high praise it gets. Truly a masterclass in filmmaking. A crime epic tale of a Mafia family whose dealing with dark business, corruption, violence, greediness, rivalry & vengeance and how it could slowly ruins them‚Ä¶  
172 Ya pude ver esta pel√≠cula en el cine, mi vida est√° hecha. 
173 sorry.. i understand your setting will influence how you feel about a film and i was more focused on not throwing my food at the people sitting behind me as they were pushing and kicking my chair 24/7 omfg enraged.this was also so long for no reason. 
174 The Godfather can have slow scenes, but it never has a single scene that feels boring.Every performance, every shot, every set, every choice made in this movie leads to a masterpiece of an experience. A wholly engrossing film that pulls you into its world, its characters and its settings and drenches you in its warm and lively atmosphere.This movie is a masterpiece in pratically every way.I also love how all that bloodshed started because don Corleone said "no" to drugs. 
175 the only thing I could think of watching this was the reference in zootopia

179  For many, "The Godfather" is a film of the century, the holy grail of the 70s and from Coppola's filmography. A film that shines through the passing decades and feels better every year. There is nothing bigger for film fans. It's a pleasure to see him in the cinema, which nobody should miss. No matter whether 80 or 18. The beginning of the history of the Mafia family Corleone in Italian-colored New York is always a maelstrom of a gangster‚Ä¶  
180 A trove of hereditary fortune fading, caught in the gnarled dominion of pride, vengeance, and fate. The apotheosis of kindred creed, beset in blood of responsibility, and penchant amore of one's ancestry. An infirmity under the weight of imbrued echelon; withering come to the clutches of once healthy hand. A belligerent dynasty that transcends sentient being, and under the sanctity of retribution, only love will bring liberty to ambition and bloodshed. Macabre in the midst of decaying souls; whilst man may have the verdict of clemency to his foe, moulding themselves as corporeal deities, time will forever be merciless to those condemned to ravening, mortal destiny. 
181 1 second = 24 frames.175 minutes (yes, let's include the credits) = 10500 seconds.10500 seconds = 252000 frames.That's 252000 frames of utter perfection. Even the couple of them with Sonny's punch missing Carlo by about a mile. The mere fact that there is something (one thing, to be exact) so boringly and insignificantly imperfect about this film makes it even more perfect. I know I'm not saying anything new here but I feel there's truly no need to. Actually, we ought to repeat the obvious more often, even if it is already repeated ad nauseam: this is an absolute masterpiece of awe-inspiring proportions. 
182 I HATE THIS MOVIE. too many men. too much lore. and FAR too long. i could not care less and every time i see that opening scene i‚Äôm filled with a deep deep rage. i cant do it anymore 
183  I ate a small dose of LSD and watched The Godfather and it was an amazing time. Five stars, the kind of movie where I want to drink in every shot, luxuriate on the texture of the faces, the darkened rooms, the brick mansions, the vast expanse of sky over cornfields half a century ago. Where I wanna crawl up inside Nino Rota's score and make a little nest and hang up Christmas lights. Where I become inexorably tethered to‚Ä¶

187 god, i wish i could to say that there are no perfect things in the world but fuck off spending 3 hours watching young hot al pacino was one of the most perfect shit i have ever experienced 
188 The definitive crime epic. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs far-fetched in the slightest to say this is the greatest film ever made, not just from a technical and storytelling perspective but also considering how it transcended American cinema. I‚Äôm on my third viewing now and it continues to amaze me in so many different ways. It‚Äôs got the single greatest character arc ever (Michael), some of the greatest performances, cinematography and writing ever and flawless direction and score - a complete masterpiece in every sense of the word. 
189 my fellow cinephiles! i am so proud to say i am finally one of you. after years and years and years of putting off watching the godfather i finally watched it and i actually really liked it and that pretty perfectly describes my relationship to most films. anyway, i would like to thank my family for supporting me through this difficult time, my friends‚Äî

197  So much has been said and written about the Godfather that really, I'd just like to take the opportunity to point out here that, if you're involved in your own individual artistic pursuits or dreams of the future (and if you're on letterboxd, I think there's a good chance you are) and feeling as though the world is stacked against you and there's no place for your ideas----------------the studio HATED Al Pacino's performance as Michael Corleone before this came‚Ä¶  
198 I'm getting really tired of watching "iconic" movies and not being as into them as I had hoped to be. I still enjoyed this for the most part though.I think I would have liked this better if it was shorter. Dragging on the wedding for 30 minutes was unnecessary. The cinematography combined with the amazing sound mixing and editing was my favourite thing about this film. The hospital scene where you hear footsteps approaching with the camera panning from hallway to hallway creates a very simplistic feeling of suspense that is rare. 
199 Sometimes you have to watch a movie 100 times before it clicks that Bonasera, the guy with the very first lines in the movie, is an undertaker. Death emerging from inky darkness in praise of the American dream.

203  "The Godfather" from 1972, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, is a masterpiece, a milestone and one of the most iconic films of all time.The haprchatcks are the Godfather (Don Vito Corleone ) played by Marlon Brando and Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) who both give a great performance.¬†This is the second film I've seen of Brando and I'm more than convinced by his acting. He fits this role perfectly and brings it across very well. Al Pacino is also outstanding‚Ä¶  
204  The Godfather is the definitive mafia film and it really stands the test of time, being one of the finest films ever made. Francis Ford Coppola not only explores this whole underworld ruled by different crime lords, but also analyzes the dilemmas and intrigues that exist in the Corleone family and all the people that surround it. You realize how every character here is crucial to the story at some point. There is a huge amount of suspense in many‚Ä¶

228  Not the first time I've seen this theatrically, but it was the best time. Last night I went and saw this at a Dolby Cinema at AMC Theatres; it was the one at Disney Springs, to be specific. The meal before the movie was not good* but getting to experience the movie again was such a great experience, it negated all those negative feelings. I have reviewed The Godfather before several years ago and that review should be read also‚Ä¶  
229 Perfect in every way, which goes without saying, but something struck me this time around that I hadn't really thought about before: What is it, exactly, that draws Michael to this life so irresistibly? We never see him enjoying the power being Godfather affords him, in fact we never see him enjoying much of anything once he joins the family business except for his time hiding in Italy. Leaving that mystery unexplained (and thus subject to endless rumination) might be this movie's masterstroke.

233 After recently finding out I was becoming my niece‚Äôs godfather, I knew it was time to watch this 
234  This review has been sitting in my notes for a minute. All we done in film class is watch good shit and one of them was this little known movie called ‚ÄúThe Godfather.‚ÄùCurrently binging the offer, I‚Äôll give my thoughts once the show is over. However if you know me or what I think about biopics then you might know my score or something. Anyways making this was a pain in the ass due to studio interference and refusal‚Ä¶

237  Watching this in cinema was everything. A complete arresting and unbelievable experience.I am a person who prefers The Godfather II a little bit than this but my god, this movie has set the benchmark for Gangster cinema. Every scene, every shot, each dialogue, each characters and the freaking score, everything is iconic here.Marlon Brando is like a lion on screen, the way he commands every second he is in is unparalleled.

240 HOLY SHIT ! Why have I waited all this time to see this masterpiece ?! And why now I want to be part of the mafia ?! Why are there so many questions ?!!! PLEASE ANSWER MEEEE 
241 Love that detail where Michael, annoyed at being reminded, says he knows to drop the gun after the restaurant hit ‚Äî but still almost forgets to drop it anyway. 
242 It‚Äôs not hyperbole to call The Godfather the greatest movie ever made. Cinema peaked with the baptism scene.¬†5/5 cannolis

244 Watched this again last night and the opening scene gave me literal chills and there they remained throughout the 3 hour runtime. 
245  For someone who claims to love anything Mafia related, it's only today in the year 2023 that I finally lost my Godfather virginity (Gotti is still on my to-do list as well). I only knew bits and pieces from the loosely adapted video game (which was surprisingly good), so pretty much everything that happened still came as a shocker.Marlon Brando was my favourite to watch here, even though I was having a hard time without subtitles. It's also interesting‚Ä¶  
246  Some films simply get better with age, and in the case of Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather, with the upgrading of technology only enhancing the viewing experience. The original VHS or even Dvd of The Godfather had that grainy, almost sepia tone around the picture quality, something that at the time crystalized the look of a film set in post-war America. It had a charm to it, but the upgrading of the sound and advanced picture definition has given Coppola's‚Ä¶

252 After rewatching The Godfather this time, now I'm completely sure and have no doubt that The Godfather is the best and the greatest movie of all the time 
253 I only watched this once before, when I was 12 years old. Even though I completely understood the nuances of organized crime in the 1940s and the deconstruction of the American dream as a pre-teen, I still enjoyed revisiting it as an adult even though I totally got it then. Four stars!

Granted that was just a couple months ago. Still I wasn‚Äôt expecting such an enthusiastic audience without a comic book character in sight. Funnily enough there was actually a row of people dressed up as the Corleones. I admired there fedoras and long coats. Totally gangster cerca 1950s. No signs‚Ä¶

263 there have always been gangster films, but this was one of the first to show the mafia from the inside and without reverting to black and white good guy/bad guy archetypes. you could argue that the characters have since become archetypal but that‚Äôs because this film has been so absorbed into culture.¬†without the Godfather, there would be no Sopranos, Goodfellas, Casino, just to name a few great movies. put it this way: while it‚Äôs not groundbreaking by today‚Äôs standards, it did help establish the ground itself.

266  I got a chance to watch Francis Ford Coppola‚Äôs iconic film for the first time in cinemas last night, and it blew me away. It‚Äôs no surprise surrounding the legacy of this film and its critical acclaim spanning 50 years, but as someone who had never seen it before, I sat in complete awe, swept away by the epic scope depicted on screen for its well-paced three hours.

269  The film is a tremendous thing, but I haven't fallen in love with it. I am realizing how artful its naturalism is, how carefully its style is woven into the script. Its clarity and elegant restraint conceals and focuses a a ferocious violence (that explodes at times in carefully controlled bursts). Much like TAXI DRIVER.Its appearance is disarming, because it seems to place everything before you. The movie is so quotable because it condenses its themes into perfect aphorisms‚Ä¶

This film is 3 hours long, but that length is never felt.

276  The Corleone Family has had several years running of excellence, at least, before the film has begun. Because the Corleones refuse to team up with lofty members from other five organized crime families in the narcotics racket because narcotics equates to unwanted exposure to authorities, that refusal leads to the beginning of a breakdown. Slowly but surely.What establishes power for the film absolutely immediately is the clout that Marlon Brando bestows. Many already know behind the scenes that Brando‚Ä¶

282  "The Godfather" is a completely enveloping experience. From the inky blacks and caramels of its color palette to the masterful arrangement of actor, prop, set piece, and camera in Francis Coppola's frame composition, the viewer is slowly and subtly engrossed visually. From a story that plays out like a knot of organized criminal machinations, to measured and deliberate-paced editing, the audience is immersed narratively.

284 Movie so good it became an adjective, in other news water molecules are composed by 2 atoms of hydrogen + 1 of oxygen, the Earth is flat and I sleep with diapers on.This is perhaps my 3rd or 4th rewatch and I keep being astonished at how neatly it holds up, it‚Äôs a weird case in which every single time feels just as if I‚Äôm watching it for the first time. And now in a fully packed theater, I mean, I‚Äôd be disgustingly drowning myself in pools of cannoli and pizza if I weren‚Äôt trying to loose weight right now. 
285  In the words of Michael Rapaport: Al Pacino changed acting, taking it from the old to the new, in so doing he woke up acting. Happy Birthday to the ALconic! Salud!Oh this movie? You already know it's a masterpiece: it's the Citizen Kane of all movies.

No hay algo que se le pueda decir que ya no se haya dicho antes, simplemente es una obra maestra del cine y de la historia humana. A partir de hoy puedo aceptar la muerte, mi destino ya se cumpli√≥.

This blend of enthralling crime epic, in-depth character study, and heart-wrenching family drama is a one of a kind creative achievement and an influential cultural milestone. Already the opening wedding sequence is as perfect as it gets, since it sucks you right into the world of the film, introduces almost‚Ä¶  
293  This film man...There‚Äôs so many reasons to why this film will be forever classed as ‚Äòthe greatest film of all time‚Äô.¬†Francis Ford Coppolla has created numorous timeless classics like,¬†The Godfather Part 2 and¬†Apocalypse now but this film will always be known as ‚Äòthe best‚Äô (and I‚Äôm a huge fan of Apocalypse Now).¬†He‚Äôs created the most recognisable and most quoted film of all time. If you ask anyone if they have heard of The Godfather, they will say‚Ä¶  
294  "I believe in America" are the first words we hear in The Godfather, part of a speech in which the eponymous organised crime figure, Don Vito Corleone, listens to a man seeking his own brand of justice, the camera slowly and carefully pulling back from the guest to take in the outline of Marlon Brando. It's the first of many iconic shots in Francis Ford Coppola's adaptation of Mario Puzo's epic crime novel, itself a masterpiece of fiction, a shot‚Ä¶  
295  A shakespearean tragedy about a man losing his soul in a plight against his fate juxtaposed with another shakespearean tragedy of a man realizing that all of his actions he made with the intention of keeping his family away from his suffering ended up creating the single thing he feared the most: dooming his bloodline.First time I actually feel I understood the movie. There's too much going on and too much to write about but one thing that stood‚Ä¶  
296  At 38 years old, I can finally say that I‚Äôve seen The Godfather. Not living under a rock, I knew that a particular character would be sleeping with the fishes and that I shouldn‚Äôt be placing any bets on a certain racehorse. Indeed, I could have compiled a bingo card of famous lines before watching it‚Äîthe film‚Äôs ubiquity in popular culture is the main reason why I never felt much need to actually watch it‚Äîbut even knowing so much doesn‚Äôt‚Ä¶  
297  It might be a fool‚Äôs errand to question The Godfather's legendary status. It‚Äôs a hallmark of classic American cinema; the blueprint story of a fall arc and a rise to power, nearly undisputed in its acclaim.I'm conflicted. On one hand, it's often a riveting slow-burn that expands in scope and tragedy until shutting the door to the heart. But I admire it, not for its cold descent into evil, but its dramatization of family. At the point in the‚Ä¶

302  The first time I saw The Godfather I wasn't as struck by it as I hoped but this rewatch solidified this as a masterpiece for me. Is it perfect? No, but its ambition and insanely high technical qualities more than make up for a few shortcomings in a dense, well written script.The standout for me is Brando's Vito Corleone who has more screen presence than any other character I've ever seen, and of course Al Pacino is as good‚Ä¶  
303 Mientras hay mucho boludo por ah√≠ pensando que los an√°lisis de pel√≠culas son excesivos y que en verdad los directores no piensan tanto sus producciones, ya mucho antes, en 1972, Francis Ford Coppola despliega El Padrino y afirma que cada toma, cada l√≠nea de guion y cada decisi√≥n que hace tiene un porqu√© en la trama. Todo est√° en su lugar y no hay nada de sobra.¬†Es la pel√≠cula m√°s completa de la historia. Imposible no emocionarse.

306  I think trying to deconstruct what it is that I love about The Godfather so much is already its greatest challenge when so much of the praise that it receives is well-deserved. The Godfather is truly one of the greatest films ever made, but trying to type up my own praises was already hard enough when I already have an ingrained fear inside of my head that what I had to say would indeed just be the same as what's‚Ä¶

308 A true epic, a dramatic saga about the corleone family chronicalling the setbacks,tragedies, deceptions amd business of a crime family and fascinating in watching the development of Al pacinos Micheal corelone from soldier to cold, brutal head pf the family. It's a classy, film tgat takes ots time building and getting to know the characters, has moments that are, tense and shakespearean like the restraunt assassination and the finale involving Micheal at a baptism and the scene cuts to brutal scenes of revenge. A film of great storytelling and performances.

312  RIP James Caan. It could've been so easy to make Sonny like any other hot-blooded mobster but he imbues so much pathos in his performance, especially in the scene where he learns of Connie's abuse, and you genuinely believe that whatever his flaws are this guy would fight tooth and nail to protect his family. A presence like no other. Hope he rests in peace.And yeah I mean, this is still *that* movie. I am still so blown away‚Ä¶

I can barely keep track of every little aspect I loved about this film.

Every performance is spot on and everyone feels like a workhorse to bring this world to life. The plot is loaded and‚Ä¶   
340  "The Godfather," directed by Francis Ford Coppola, is not just a film but a cultural phenomenon that has profoundly shaped the landscape of cinema. The 1972 epic, based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, paints a powerful portrait of the Corleone family and its entanglement in the world of organized crime. The cinematic brilliance extends across multiple layers, from the stellar acting to the profound narrative, from the impressive visual design to the memorable music.The performances in‚Ä¶

As I settled into my seat, it was as if time lost all meaning and 3 hours just flew by.From the very first frame, the incredible cinematography immersed me and made me feel like I was back in bygone era, and to this day visually "The Godfather" is as impressive‚Ä¶

357 I've made a much longer review before so I'll keep this one short because everyone knows how great The Godfather is. The storytelling, acting performances, music, writing, directing, cinematography, pacing and themes are all perfect and it's arguably the greatest depiction of crime ever.It has some of my favourite shots, some of my favourite scenes and has the greatest group of characters in cinema. Each of the characters has value and importance and the development throughout is absolutely sensational. Will be re-watching The Godfather Part Two tonight.98/100 üåπ

The story had me invested the whole way through, the cinematography is stunning, the musical score is amazing, the direction is phenomenal, the editing is brilliant, the pacing is great, and not once was I ever bored, the screenplay is fantastic, there are many disturbing, intense, and shocking moments, there are‚Ä¶

365 Could've used more cannoli. Besides that, pretty great. 
366 This hit different after watching the sopranos 
367 The final act of this film is where cinema hit its absolute peak and nothing will come close. Iconic scene after iconic scene, greatest ensemble cast and Nino Rota‚Äôs score make this one of my absolute favourites. You ain‚Äôt serious if you believe the myth that Godfather 2 is better, I‚Äôm sorry.

369 Honestly the fact that this movie can hold my attention for a whole three hours should be proof enough for anyone that it is indeed one of the best - if not the best - films to have ever been made. 
370 I literally cannot believe it took me this long to finally get to this. It‚Äôs easily one of the best movies I‚Äôve ever seen, and I don‚Äôt know how you could give The Godfather anything other than a 5. Probably the best cast in movie history?! Also, this may sound super weird, but there are some fantastic murders in this movie. P.S. I was really surprised by the fact that they didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúfuck‚Äù once. I think seeing Goodfellas before this really twisted my expectations. üòÇ 
371 I just couldn't get into it. It's way too long with too many characters and I was just so bored. I'd heard so many great things about this so my expectations were really high but the movie never met them.

Great plot, great characters, memorable quotes and scenes.Al Pacino plays the role of Michael Corlone great!The character development of many of the characters is very good in the film.It's a must see for everyone!Rating: 5/5 
373  This is one of the few films I simply have nothing bad to say about. All the acting performances are amazing honestly, but you gotta give it to Marlon Brando, who has a unique presence, and Al Pacino. The transformation of his character Michael, who seemed pretty ordinary and innocent in the beginning, into a powerful man emerging in the world of organized crime was magnificent and it couldn‚Äôt have happened without Al Pacino‚Äôs impactful performance.The story is flawless,‚Ä¶

375  The Godfather is probably one of those movies that everyone assumes you‚Äôve seen when you say you love film‚Äîbut tonight was my first time. What‚Äôs there to say that hasn‚Äôt already been said. Timeless, iconic and beautiful. It was such a treat to sit down to watch this from start to finish. It kept me consumed with it‚Äôs story and characters, and despite the 3 hour runtime, I almost didn‚Äôt want it to end. Just brilliant overall. Really looking forward‚Ä¶  
376  Nun hab ich es also endlich geschafft. Nach 2 Jahren Prime Mitgliedschaft, 2 Jahre an M√∂glichkeit einen der gr√∂√üten Filme zu sehen, aber dennoch 2 Jahren Aufschieben von diesem, hab ich "Der Pate" nun endlich gesehen. Gerade, weil der Film eben als einer der besten, vielleicht sogar den besten Film aller Zeiten genannt wird, habe ich mich sehr davor gef√ºrchtet. Aber es hilft ja nichts, irgendwann muss man dann ja auch mal ran. Was meine Erwartungen angeht, die wahren doch‚Ä¶  
377  Absolutely masterful. Young Pacino and De Niro were fun to see but Marlon Brando absolutely stole the show. The gravitas his character was able to maintain was incredibly impressive and I truly felt the weight of his words and the magnitude of his presence.Beyond being elegantly written and directed, this movie is wildly entertaining and builds tension, and creates suspense wonderfully. When Michael goes to the Italian restaurant and has to go to the bathroom... that was so good.‚Ä¶  
378  What is there to be said about this film that hasn‚Äôt been said? 176 minutes of cinema at its finest. Nearly every seen is iconic and can be seen, heard, felt in hundreds of films and TV shows since then. So many people where listed to play these roles, but can anyone see anyone else in these roles and feel like it would have been better. I know a lot of near 3 hour movies that drag on and on‚Ä¶  
379  I know I'm late to the party but hey it's better late than never. Numerous people been hyping this to me for months so understandably my expectations for this film was extremely high but sadly, it barely misses the mark for me.

381 Family ties that bind. Not a structuralist work (the possible commentary in capitalism is merely hinted at and never actually articulated), but a very focused and dramatically competent story of a man who climbs the crime ladder given the imperishable net of family. I think the main reason for this film‚Äôs timeless success lies in the way its script manages to really condensate only essential informations, everything contributes directly to the narrative, which is no easy feat considering its running time. Storytelling in one of its most palpable conditions.

387 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   You didn't need a friend like me. But, now you come to me, and you say: "Don Corleone, give me justice." But you don't ask with respect. You don't offer friendship. You don't even think to call me Godfather.

Even as I sit here wracked by the fever dream of peak covid-19 symptoms, I was transported. I teared up at Fredo's delayed reaction to seeing his father on the ground after being shot five times.

390 FILM #1,000!Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.I don't have to write about how much I loved this film. It's imfamously one of the best films to exist. But I'm going to anyway.The Godfather is a 1972 masterpiece that can be summed up in the word 'perfect'. Its acting? Perfect. Its cinematography. Perfect. The story, script, characters and just about everything else? Absolutely perfect. Despite its almost 3 hour long runtime and slow pacing, this film doesn't feel like it goes on forever and ever. 
391 Damn I really wanted to give this something controversial but I can‚Äôt 
392 Much prefer the film's first and final hours to its bizarrely paced middle portion. Michael's trip to Italy just isn't interesting and I don't buy his heel-turn when he returns, but otherwise it's just as enjoyable as it is compelling and the finale is spectacular. 
393 Did you know that George Lucas helped Francis Ford Coppola shoot and finish The Godfather? He actually shot a few things, like the newspaper shots. He even taught Coppola a few filmmaking tips about building suspense.So every time you call George Lucas a fat idiot cunt who nuked the fridge or jumped the shark or sold out, just remember he had more than a little something to do with arguably the greatest American picture ever filmed (literally).

And yeah, this is an investing, very well crafted, well directed, and just an incredible movie. It's regarded as the greatest movie ever made and I can totally see why. There isn't anything left for me to say, I think everyone knows every single reason why this movie is amazing. And on another note, I can finally watch other movies!!!! Yay!!!

449 An operatic legend of Italian passion becomes a quintessential piece of American mythology. Nearly every scene of this film has the Corleones wearing masks; masks for loved ones, masks for enemies, even masks for themselves. The perpetual disguise the Corleones put on for the world makes sense when confronted with the terrible truth of their lives. The only truth, the only reality in Michael's fragile existence as the heir to his father's kingdom of decadence, is violence. Well, violence and delicious food.

473  It would be a cliche to call The Godfather a novelistic film or the greatest film of all time, but those labels are kinda correct. It begins with a wedding and ends with the funeral of a soul.

475  Concurrently documenting not only 10 years of the Corleone family but also the inner workings of their dynasty and its tumultuous members, Francis Ford Coppola‚Äôs¬†The Godfather earns its place as one of the most highly respected films of all time.

479  Probably the greatest film ever made. No film, at least from what I've seen, has been able to tap into and utilize the endless bounds of the cinematic art form to create something so grand and powerful.

It's a film immortally intertwined with movie history and culture, a film where it's near impossible to go a minute without hearing an iconic line, a film‚Ä¶

488 Had a strong desire to watch Part 2, only felt right to watch this again first. It‚Äôs not perfect, but any flaws are so minor they disappear in the 3 hour journey. 
489  It's been a good 15 years since I watched The Godfather and revisiting this classic was definitely worth the time, but not just for the iconic characters or the incredible themes of family, power and moral values; I felt a strong sense of mythic storytelling in Coppola's interesting gangster cycle. Michael's arc, as fascinating and complex as it is, strikes me as a corollary to Sauron from the Lord of the Rings, Lucifer from Paradise Lost, or Prometheus from Greek‚Ä¶  
490 It‚Äôs legit freaky how dead silent and still Michael‚Äôs eyes become as the movie goes forward. His posture becomes completely different too. It‚Äôs scary stuff. You can‚Äôt overstate how magnificent Pacino is. It‚Äôs a bonkers performance. From thirty minutes on, he‚Äôs an entirely different person that lacks humor, a smile, and becomes exactly what the Don wanted to hopefully rise above one day.‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt enough time, Michael. Wasn‚Äôt enough time.‚Äù

492  Now here it is, one of the movies I was most looking to watching in this Coppola watchthrough.This is just a masterpiece and I think that it's undeniable. What I like the most about this movie is the world building and the character arcs as both of those things are just brilliant. Coppola just gets you so intrigued in the world and the characters and the main cast just helps it.Marlon Brando is one of the best ever‚Ä¶  
493 I now see Tom Hagen's trip to Hollywood, which occurs early in the film, as a tacit acknowledgement the story we are about to see is the product of fantasy‚Äîit's likely no crime lord was ever as honorable or virtuous as Vito Corleone is depicted here. And yet I totally accept Brando's romanticized portrayal of Vito in "The Godfather," just as I'm chilled by Michael's anti-baptism during the finale; a man denouncing Satan and his works even as he willingly becomes evil incarnate. 
494 i can't say i've ever processed a single plot point of this movie because young al pacino is just so devastatingly hot to me that i really get nothing else out of it 
495 Italians whacking each other has been a cinema staple for almost 50 years and this movie is the g o d f a t h e r of that cultural cornerstone. 
496  ‚ÄúI believe in America. America has made my fortune.‚ÄùDeath has made his fortune. The undertaker has approached Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) on this, the day of the Don‚Äôs daughter‚Äôs wedding, to ask a favor‚Äîthat the Don enact vengeance against the boys who beat the undertaker's daughter. When the Don later seeks repayment of that favor, the currency is the undertaker's services as mortician, to make the body of the Don‚Äôs son, Sonny (James Caan), presentable for viewing. Death‚Ä¶  
497  THERES A CHRISTMAS SCENE. The godfather is a Christmas film. Now I can watch this, on her majesties secret service and die hard on the same day.Yeah I mean‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the godfather.

498  At the heart of being a Don, the life Vito hoped to spare his son, Michael, is a core contradiction which must be held in precious balance, the struggle between life and death, violence and affection, matters business and personal. What's immediately noticeable about Coppola's immense translation of Puzo's novel is how much more sauce he stirs in. The novel, a huge hit, is pulp entertainment that misses a lot of detail and gets basic terminology wrong. This film, by‚Ä¶

I can¬¥t say much more about the movie than I already have, except that it hits different on the big screen. It¬¥s even more epic, elegant, and immersive, and a true feast for eyes and ears. The Sicily sequence is breathtakingly gorgeous (poor Apollonia), and the baptism montage is the pinnacle of filmmaking. But then again, I could also mention any other scene. This film is cinema at its best. 
510 As is the case with all great epics, The Godfather is as intimate and personal as it is colossal in scope. There is not a single shallow performance from any cast member, FFC‚Äôs of control of the camera and colour palette are sublime, and the narrative is emotional, brutal, and altogether complex. One of the greatest films of all time.501 Must-See Movies Journey 
511 It‚Äôs kinda insane how good this movie is. It‚Äôs just world class. Every single element is right and true. Al Pacino‚Äôs eyes are worth a thesis alone. The way he can conduct and enlist so many emotions, so many sonnets and words with a mere stare is something else. 
512  This movie is essential to being apart of my family (at least the Italian side, which I have spent much more time with than the other parts collectively combined (also what I identify with/as the most)). I was told I wasn't a man until I watched it, so at the ripe age of 8, I was ushered into a new world. Already a budding cinephile, this took things to another level. I've seen this film so many times over the‚Ä¶  
513 The Godfather is an incredible film. There isn't much else to say that hasn't been stated a multitude of times by people who write much better than me. But I have to say Marlon Brando and Al Pacino provide acting performances, which shouldn't be possible. Their dedication to the craft is a breathtaking thing to witness. Honestly, we should put their faces on Mount Rushmore instead of those loser presidents that are up there now.

(As an example, even something as far removed as Game of Thrones is in debt to the world building that was pioneered in this film.)Obviously everything works here and we‚Äôve heard all the takes and dissected this thing to hell and back. The only thing I‚Äôll add is that Michael‚Äôs arc is maybe the best character‚Ä¶

531 It's my birthday today, so I decided to watch one of my all-time favourite films. 
532  In both preparation of watching "The Offer" on Paramount and getting married to an Italian woman next weekend, it's time to watch the Godfather series for the first time since I've been in high school. And to no surprise, its still so great.Not much to say that hasn't been said before. So many characters, so many families and yet it all flows so easily.

541 Watching this for the 50th anniversary in a Dolby theatre was a great experience. It was a offer I simply couldn‚Äôt refuse.¬†What more can be said about Francis Ford Coppola‚Äòs quintessential gangster epic? Well it‚Äôs easy to see why this is a landmark film in American cinema. Marlo Brando is absolutely captivating as Don Corleone and everything the man does is iconic at this point. Mixed with the killer¬†supporting cast especially a young future star in Al Pacino. Nino Rita‚Äôs famous score only elevates this violent tale on family and power.Endlessly imitated but one of a kind. 
542 ‚ÄúI‚Äôll make him an offer he can‚Äôt refuse.‚ÄùSaw this in Dolby cinemas today and I can confidently say it was one of the best experiences I‚Äôve ever had. Once in a lifetime moment!

546 It‚Äôs absolutely baffling how much better this is than the sequel. I know it‚Äôs the most obvious thing I could ever say about this movie, but boy oh boy Brando‚Äôs really good here. Also Micheal is actually entertaining in this one. And the story isn‚Äôt 3 hours of boredom.

551 This week I‚Äôve had a craving for The Godfather. I can‚Äôt stop humming the Love Theme and so I decided I‚Äôd watch it again today. It‚Äôs such a feel-good movie, especially when Michael is renouncing Satan while having all his enemies murdered. 
552 Quickie Review¬†It's a masterpiece of not just the crime drama genre or the epic movie sub-genre but of movies in general. Everytime I watch it, I feel fully appreciative of it. If you've seen it before, then you already know how much of a classic it is. If you haven't, then why are you still here reading this? Get to wherever you watch movies and watch it. You have no excuses! Sorry for my passion but it's THAT good. 
553  It's two o'clock in the morning here, and that means that it is officially Easter. Now, Easter has always been a big part of my family, and the holiday was always synonymous with large family gatherings.What does this have to do with The Godfather? Well, not a whole lot. But I finally picked up the Coppola restoration on BluRay and I decided that this Easter I was going to have a little marathon. I'm going to spend the holiday‚Ä¶

Some are easier than others, but it's almost always doable.Having said that, The Godfather is one of the easiest reviews I'm probably going to write this year. It has great and‚Ä¶

578 I felt like a proud big brother, when my younger brother asked me, if I wanted to watch ‚ÄúThe Godfather‚Äù with him (he hasn¬¥t seen it before). Of course, I would never say no to that. Fortunately, he liked the film and wants to watch more classics in the future. Personally, I have nothing new to add to the conversation. ‚ÄúThe Godfather‚Äù is a milestone of American cinema and a masterclass in every aspect of filmmaking. 175 minutes of total immersion.

582  Having a long flight yesterday, there was no better way to burn some time than to lock in for 3 hours rewatching this absolute classic. It‚Äôs the kind of film which seems to get better and better every time you watch it, as you‚Äôll notice a particular quote or revisit a scene you did not remember being that great the previous time.

584  When I first watched this when I was 11, this taught me everything about what films could be and was for the longest time, my favorite film. Over the three hour film, we see Michael Corleone transform from an at least surface level, innocent man, into a crime boss, and into the Devil incarnate himself. Michael is drawn into a destiny that pushes him deeper into his family‚Äôs business until it becomes his entire life. When we first meet him,‚Ä¶

590  I now fully understand the texture of all the Dolmio adverts. As a lifelong devotee of cinema, I found decades of excuses for swerving this epic achievement. Goodfellas knocked me for six. I followed Tony Soprano for 6 seasons. And still I didn't watch it. Is it because Peter Griffin said it "insists upon itself"?Whatever, I saw it today.After I celebrate with a bowl of spaghetti and some fist-sized meatballs, what I just watched might sink in a bit‚Ä¶

592  Task #9: a film people have said I cant believe you've not seen that about3 and a half stars is actually a pretty high rating for me. But in the context of how highly regarded The Godfather is I can practically hear my followers spitting out their coffees in shock from overseas. So let me explain.I think this movie is rightly praised. I totally get why a lot of people wouldn't shy away from straight up calling it‚Ä¶  
593  Il Padrino si inserisce, a suo modo, in quel filone nostalgico largamente frequentato dai cineasti della New Hollywood, all'interno del quale si rielaborano e si rivitalizzano, secondo un linguaggio molto esplicito, distantissimo dalle precedenti convenzioni stilistiche e di contenuto, i generi classici del cinema. Il soggetto - il mondo degli immigrati dediti al crimine - √® infatti gi√† stato alla base di molti film in passato, ma grazie allo straordinario talento di Francis Ford Coppola e Mario Puzo, e alle‚Ä¶  
594 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   **Part of the Best Picture Project**It feels pointless writing a review of one of the most reviewed films of all time so I'll just make some notes of things I noticed with this watch of the film, along with some stuff that's always been on my mind.-It's interesting how all Corleone males die outside on what is mostly a bright clear day. Sure, Fredo is killed as the sun is coming up, but from what we see it‚Ä¶   
595 A classic that is almost surpassed it's by it's own cult popularity and yet it's not because it is simply one of the best films ever. The themes, the structure, the characters, the music: it's all a rapturous symphony of perfection. Brando would've been remembered for A Streetcar Named Desire or On the Waterfront, but with The Godfather, he's immortalized. Pacino delivers a powerhouse performance that should've garnered him an Oscar. The way Coppola so carefully balances everything, within pretty much a genre film, is a marvel. 
596 And my eyes see Oppenheimer‚Ä¶.

600 every smug know-it-all above the age of 50 tries so fucking hard to be Don Carleone . The godfather is to them what Emo Bruce Wayne is to 20 year old loners lolits reallly brilliant how well the charecters in this progress without it even being too explicit. Especially the way each shot with Al Pacino is directed , its brilliantly genius. 3 hours didnt feel long. cant wait to watch the sequels. Also , i want to buy myself a new suit now. thats how that left me feeling. 
601 Pretty good 
602 A surprisingly slow burn for such a widely loved film. The biggest strength in my opinion are the palpable characters that are fleshed out by little gestures, like Michael's calm hands outside the hospital. It tells a rich story about the corruption of the American Dream and the human condition in general.

605  I was scared of going into this knowing that I don't enjoy gangster movies as much as others, but being one of the¬†most famous movies of all time with some of the best ratings, I really hoped this would be a perfect film for me.

606  Earlier today I was talking to my oldest brother, and I mentioned how during a conversation with our other brother we both thought it was funny how neither of us, despite having a fair bit of Italian blood in our family, have seen The Godfather.

608 Most boring thing I‚Äôve ever watched. No I will not elaborate or apologize 
609 The Godfather is an amazing movie, in storytelling, acting and direction. A timeless classic that simply holds up in every single way. 
610 Been about 10 years since I‚Äôve gotten to sit down with the Corelones (and inspired by James Can‚Äôs passing) and after THE OFFER series and reading KEEP THE GUN, TAKE THE CANOLI book it was an enriching screening knowing all the inside info.¬†A bonafide cinematic masterpiece that feels old-fashioned and still ahead of it‚Äôs time that gets tastier every time I watch it.¬†Also, it‚Äôs a GREAT viewing when paired with Italian food and red wine. 
611  To be completely honest, there‚Äôs nothing new I can add to the discourse on The Godfather. Maybe the greatest film of all time? It‚Äôs certainly in my Top 20 favorite films ever. It‚Äôs amazing. For a film that just turned 50 years old, not only does it still hold up, each time I watch this film I find myself shockingly compelled for nearly 3 hours. With this rewatch I don‚Äôt even think I grabbed my phone or checked the time.‚Ä¶

623  Seen in TheatersA beautifully violent, almost poetic, look at the decay of American morality in the 20th Century, Francis Ford Coppola‚Äôs The Godfather was a film that was long overdue for a rewatch. Luckily, this time came in a theater and seeing it on a big screen. As with any rewatch, knowing the plot helps one to really focus in on the little intricacies that are missed in an initial viewing. Here, the part that left me awed was‚Ä¶  
624 M A S T E R P I E C E. I wasn't watching at all. I was EXPERIENCING. The Godfather seemed like an extremely luscious supper bursting with flavours that was chewed gloriously well for me by the gods (but not gross). 
625 A wedding; a horse's head; a dinner; a toll; one baptism; a father and his family. And here we have the first part of the biggest cinematic masterpiece ever made! Not just a mafia and crime story, but a modern epic about love, loyalty, la famiglia! 
626  By this point it is a cliche to label this film as the best movie of all time. if it's true is besides the point but am I the only one feeling that movies like this aren't made anymore? which is another cliche statement in of itself.

Thank you, Godfather, for initiating me into the world of cinema. You are the first film I remember seeing. My parents took me, as a 3-year-old, to see you at our local Drive-In.

641 Initially, I was going to write a long-winded review about one of the best films ever made. I was going to mention the color orange, talk about the sudden violence, Brando's performance, etc, but then I realized...... far better reviewers than me have said all that can be said on the subject.So take some time to read a couple of in-depth reviews of The Godfather and gain even further insight into this masterful film.

It's simultaneously an impeccably-written and beautifully-scored drama, a superb character study in which even the smallest characters ring true, a breathtaking schooling in color cinematography, and overall a remarkable‚Ä¶

P.S.: The opening scene. The baptism contrast scene. The ending scene. Oh my. P.S.S.: So that was 3 hours???!

This is what some I think would refer to as ‚Äúperfect‚Äù filmmaking between its performances, cinematography, composition etc. and there is a lot to admire in those respective departments. From a visual standpoint I actually preferred the portions in Italy, it drew me into the story more and the terrain‚Ä¶  
667 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  I tried watching this a couple of years ago and could only get through about an hour of it because it was so slow. This time, I thankfully had more luck with it. It has more funny moments than I remembered, and I thought that this could maybe be a 5-star film based on the first part. However, the film really dragged for me at some points. #FUCKBARZINI  
668 Without a doubt, The Godfather is one of the most vital classic films ever made. Not only is it a towering, masterful cinematic achievement, but it also broke new ground for American cinema, ushering in a whole new wave of influential directors and screenwriters.

676  i realize this is very annoying to admit but my main takeaway is a very smug vindication: that in spite of the prestige and acclaim, in spite of the Self Insisting majesty that covers the whole thing, in spite of the inevitable backlash that its too boring and stuffy, that the thrills and emotions of the godfather are based in pure pulp. a borderline soap operatic series of intricate relationships and duties and betrayals and bursts of violence, delivered in‚Ä¶

681  What to say that hasn't already been said about the Godfather. This is my third time watching and it gets better every time. It's a revolutionary film that is one of the few I've never seen anyone call bad. Overrated? Sure but no one can deny just how incredible this film is.

Surely, one of the greatest, faultless performances the world of filmmaking has ever seen. The Godfather is not only a landmark for American cinema, but a superb adaptation that surpasses the source material in every way. I‚Äôve yet to see a better written film with quite this finesse and power.

702  - "Where's Michael?"My thoughts exactly, Vito. Where's the goat?The first time I watched the Godfather I nearly fell asleep by the end. Not out of boredom, but because I hadn't slept in 30 hours, and despite that I thought against my need for slumber due to my complete enthrallment. I needed to see if Michael would say "Yes." or "No." in that final scene. I don‚Äôt understand how modern consensus is this is a boring or pretentious high‚Ä¶  
703 Have they ever considered maybe turning the lights on? 
704  I did not care for The Godfather. Did not care for The Godfather. Didn't like it. Fine actors. Did not like the movie. Couldn't get into it. It insists upon itself. It insists upon itself. It takes forever getting in, and then you spend-- you spend like six and a half hours and then-- You know I can't even get through. I can't even finish the movie. I've never even seen the ending. I have tried on three separate occasions‚Ä¶  
705  I haven't seen The Godfather in nearly two years, and today I randomly put it on like it was nothing. But it's The Godfather. I started it with the intention of turning it off due to its length and how late it was, but since my dad sat down and began watching it, I proceeded to watch the rest of the film not knowing I had already seen an hour. To many, movies don't get better than this, and yeah,‚Ä¶  
706 I won‚Äôt have anything to say about this film that hasn‚Äôt been said before. With that being said, the characters in here are great, the cinematography is amazing, there‚Äôs iconic quotes, the plot is very interesting, and the performances by the cast are perfect. 
707  There‚Äôs just something about this movie, some small unnamed thing, that just won‚Äôt fully click with me. There‚Äôs a lot to love about The Godfather. It is a revolutionary piece of cinema, and I do not say that lightly. The arcs, the dialogue, the structure, the filmmaking, are all so intricately done and so impressively cinematic that when people call it ‚Äúa masterpiece‚Äù and ‚Äúthe greatest film of all time‚Äù, it‚Äôs hard for me to disagree.¬†Unfortunately, I just don‚Äôt see‚Ä¶  
708 First time seeing The Godfather in a movie theater. God bless The Screening Room. 
709  First time seeing the film since I was fourteen, so it's been fifteen years, maybe sixteen, not sure. Pretty fascinating watch considering I only remembered around fifteen minutes worth of the entire three hour run time. I probably wouldn't put the film in my top twenty, but it's hard to pretend that it doesn't fully earn its place in film history and that it isn't highly considered for a very good reason.There are parts in the film I really‚Ä¶  
710 Well shit, that was fucking amazing.¬†This film truly is a masterpiece. I always thought it was all about Italian gangsters and shootings with nothing over the top. How wrong I was. After years of hearing how great The Godfather is my expectations were really high, but holy shit it lives up to them, just brilliant.Also I gotta say, im in love with the editing and composition of this whole film, sosososo goooood. 
711  Francis Ford Coppola‚Äôs sprawling crime saga is the definitive movie about taking over the family business because it elegantly builds off of nearly-universal truths about both family and business from a hyper-masculinized perspective. It fixates on the anxiety of unavoidably becoming your own father, the fear of letting down your family by forging your own path, the transformatively healing effect of reconnecting with your roots, and the cutthroat selfishness necessary to maintain power.¬†And by repeatedly insisting on the distinction between‚Ä¶  
712  Something that always stuck out to me about this film is how it uses children throughout the course of its narrative. At different points, years fly by within the matter of minutes and the child characters (who are mostly reserved for the background) are used to confirm the film's time jumps and temporal ellipses. The film begins on the day of Connie Corleone-Rizzi's wedding, or in other words, traditionally speaking, the day a child becomes a woman as she is‚Ä¶  
713 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   "Is it true?""No."Organized crime unfurls into an unorganized, rampant, violent mess, only to be cleaned up, baptized with blood by the innocent, now guilty. The tragedy at the heart of The Godfather really doesn't strike until that final, masterful shot. It's a deeply elegiac, utterly devastating moment that tends to get glanced over by those too willing to label the film as a glorification of crime. The murder of Carlo, in principle, gels with the moral code of‚Ä¶   
714 Rewatching the godfather films because I really wanted to, and I always forget how powerful the death scenes really are. If you rarely watch this, it surprises you with each new viewing due to how masterfully this was put together. Also, part of the reason I wanted to watch this film is because I'm starting film school this fall and one of the professors was the co-producer of these films and a close friend of Coppola's.

722  Okay so I'm sort of conflicted with The Godfather. The term gets thrown around a lot, but the majority of film fans agree it's a masterpiece. And from a technical standpoint, I agree. The cinematography, Marlon Brando's performance, the editing (especially in the baptism scene), the unwasted violence, Al Pacino's equally brilliant performance, the themes of family, revenge, hatred and love, and the whole story of it being a man's descent into cold-blooded monstrosity. All of that is great and‚Ä¶

728  BLINDSPOT ADDRESSED.I can see where The Godfather is iconic. There's not much more I can add, other than some of my own observations. I've stated before that I'm not into mob-themed movies, but some takeaways here made me see it as much more than just that.I'm sure I'm not alone, but I thoroughly loved Michael's (Al Pacino) arc from a reluctant part of the family to grappling with identity to being the Don with all the power.

734  Film #2 of the 100 Degrees, 100 Movies ChallengeCommon actor from previous film: Marlon BrandoPREVIOUS FILM: Apocalypse NowNEXT FILM: The Godfather: Part IIThe Godfather is the movie with the highest average rating on Letterboxd and is also a movie I had never seen before, which is weird. I love mafia stories and I love good movies, so this should be a natural fit, right? Hell yeah it is!This might just be the closest thing to‚Ä¶  
735 What day and time can I catch Clemenza's Italian cooking show on The Food Network? 
736 I was tired while watching this, therefore I could not give it the full 5 stars it (probably) deserves. Please forgive me. Don't whack me. Thanks.Also, a very disappointing 4K - the base transfer seems good detail-wise (can't speak for the color grading), but the film grain was weirdly following the movements of all the actors, and some shots seemed to be DNRed. Haven't seen compression / encoding issues this bad before. 
737  So I‚Äôve never actually seen The Godfather. The 50th anniversary rerelease seemed like a good time to rectify that. I obviously knew bits and pieces just from cultural osmosis, but I was surprised at how little of the plot had actually been spoiled for me. I was genuinely surprised at multiple points. With a film this big, everything clever has already been said, so I‚Äôm not going to go too deep. I loved how engaging it was, and how none‚Ä¶  
738 Imagine not wanting to be married to a guy who does crimes lmao grow up crime is awesome 
739 Cinema peaked at the montage of death during the baptism. 
740  The film starts on Bonasera‚Äôs face, visibly in despair. As the camera slowly zooms away, he recounts how his beloved daughter was beaten to within an inch of her life and that her assailants didn‚Äôt spend one single day in jail for their crime. By the time he has reached the end of his story, he is begging for the help of the man whose head has now entered the frame. He has listened attentively, sitting on the proverbial throne‚Ä¶  
741 top 30 favorites: boxd.it/aLi70this is my 30th favorite film of all time and it's the last one on my list! thank you all for commenting and liking my reviews throughout this short time, i enjoyed reviewing my 30 favorite movies and it may surprise you guys but i actually haven't rewatched them, i just made reviews for them, i WOULD have liked to rewatch them but i don't have enough time. anyway...i love all of these films and i love you guys.btw this movie is great. 
742 women need to steal this masterpiece from the filmbros bc michael corleone looks like he gets pegged 
743 There is no question, this is the best movie I‚Äôve seen. I‚Äôve spent so long waiting to watch this film. I love Marlon Brando‚Äôs performance. I‚Äôve never been so attentive watching a 3 hour movie before. The plot was written so well that it stands the test of over 50 years now. The Godfather is obviously an all time classic, I have yet to see Goodfellas, so it‚Äôll be interesting to see which I prefer but the bottom line is clear, if you haven‚Äôt seen The Godfather, go watch it! It is a masterpiece. 
744 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  After everything that's happened, which are the brutality of a corrupt police man, an attempted murder on his loving father, murders of his true love and earlier his brother, no wonder Michael has lost his soul.The scene where Michael tells Carlo that now everyone's dead reminds me now so much of that scene when Gus tells Hector that he killed everyone in his family.  
745 "Fredo, you‚Äôre my older brother, and I love you. But don‚Äôt ever take sides with anyone against the family again. Ever."my father still gets confused when i tell him this is not in my letterboxd four. he acts like if i just told him its the worst movie i‚Äôve ever seen. 
746 Finally got around to seeing this one and you all already know it's great. Thing is though, I've heard so many impressions of Marlon Brando's performance that hearing him in this one sounds like an impression too. It's that iconic.The Best Movies List 
747 watching the movie isn‚Äôt enough, i need to have a passionate love affair with michael corleone. 
748  A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man.¬†-Vito Corleone¬†The Godfather is the first serious¬†film I remember watching multiple times with my family replacing the likes of E.T., The Goonies and Ghostbusters. It‚Äôs also the first film I remember having conversations with Mom about film characters. Not the performances, but character motivations, arcs, ect.¬†Mom wouldn‚Äôt actually use the words ‚Äúcharacter arc‚Äù, but I always remembered how she loved to talk‚Ä¶  
749 Stupid me back in 2016 thought that this is just an okay film ü•≤ 
750 this is exactly what being president of a student organization at uf is like 
751 Wenn man auch beim x-ten Mal in diversen Szenen immer noch H√ºhnerhaut bekommt, dann sagt das einiges aus. Diese Performance von Marlon Brando! Dieser Score! Sch√∂n auch, dass die Serie nun in 4k vorliegt. Ich hab zwar "nur" die Itunes Fassung aber da kann man echt nicht klagen.Ein Film f√ºr die Ewigkeit. 
752 Luca Brasi reciting his lines before meeting the Don is what I look like before recording on 70mm. 
753  The Godfather, what can I remark that hasn't already been said? This violent, sprawling epic stands the testament of time as a true masterpiece of art and arguably the most defining paragon of filmmaking in the history of the medium. Francis Ford Coppola's spellbinding direction, Marlon Brando delivering the greatest acting performance in history marvelously complemented by Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan; Gordon Willis' groundbreaking cinematography and Nino Rota's iconic score together deliver what can only be called‚Ä¶  
754 I always hesitate to watch Classic films that I already know will be great because I have this mentality that if I watch them I would have none left to look forward to. Anyway, I'm glad I finally got to this because it was great but I don't have much to say that hasn't been said already. It's The Godfather.

756 There‚Äôs a reason this is considered the greatest film of all time. Somehow when I first watched it I wasn‚Äôt overly impressed when judging by it‚Äôs hype. But every time I rewatched it I manage to find new things I love about it. And after watching the cine-files podcast on the film it‚Äôs helped me appreciate it even more. Perfect cast, perfect direction, perfect writing, perfect score, perfect pacing. It‚Äôs the greatest ever. Not my favourite ever but definitely the greatest. Self proclaimed film enthusiasts who don‚Äôt like this film don‚Äôt deserve to call them selves fans of film. 
757  52 Years In 52 Weeks: 2021 Edition9. 1972-----------------------------------------------------------------------------There is always that nagging worry in the back of my head when I watch a critically acclaimed movie, that if I don't like this I will look like an uneducated slack jaw. Lucky for me that this was actually good.So basically Marlon Brando is a maffia boss with a funny voice who tries to keep his cool as the ravages of time (and scary men with guns) slowly‚Ä¶  
758 As close to flawless as any film could ever be 
759  the thing i need to mention first about The Godfather is the brilliant score. i always loved the theme song, i'm a classically trained orchestra member for more than 10 years now and i was always familiar with the song but it hits way harder now that i actually watched the film. wonderfully harmonious.the pacing was really slow in the beginning but it's impressive how well it picked itself up. it was much more enjoyable than i thought it‚Ä¶  
760 imma say it. while i appreciate the technicalities of the film like the cinematography, the direction, the writing, etc., i was SOOOOOOOOO¬†bored!!! 
761 i love my 5‚Äô2 gangster husband 
762 i checked again and it‚Äôs still a masterpiece ! 
763 young al pacino could lowkey get it üò≥ 
764 one of my fave parts was when someone started crying and instead of a tissue someone offscreen just silently hands them a drink and yup that‚Äôs how we‚Äôre going into 2020! 
765 I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything else I can add that hasn‚Äôt already been said. 
766 How many actors became stars from being able to hold a static closeup of just sitting there and thinking? Pacino does it and it's so goddamn powerful it becomes a motif for the entire series. Seeing him master the art of acting for the screen in concert with Michael Corleone's own ascent to power .... Gotta love the cinema, baby. 
767 look, i don't dislike this movie franchise really, but i don't love it either. it's just not my cup of tea. i get how people would like it or even love it, i'm just not really into gangster/mob stuff that much. or violence. but i see the appeal. 
768 Masterpiece!Nothing else to really say. 
769  ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell me you‚Äôre innocent. It hurts my intelligence and it makes me angry.‚ÄùLast night I rewatched The Godfather. I always loved this film but after my rewatch I‚Äôm pretty sure I like it even more. Personally I‚Äôm a big fan of mob movies.. and this brings my love for them even higher. The Godfather has probably some of the best dialogue in cinema history. With fantastic dialogue comes an amazing story that sets up a whole trilogy, outstanding‚Ä¶  
770 "Do you renounce Satan?" I've wanted to watch this in the theater for so long, and I've finally done it. This was one of the best moviegoing experiences I've ever had. The fact that I watched this alone, with very few people in the auditorium give it this cool feeling. Needless to say, this film is absolutely perfect, and it's a worthy contender for the title of "The Greatest Film Ever Made." 
771 I wish this was my first viewing because watching the baptism scene on the big screen is one of the best theater experiences I've ever had!!! Also Sonny beating Carlo with a literal garbage can in the middle of the street? A Real Hero.mp3 
772  This is my first review on the site, so I thought, why not start with the best? There isn't much that can be said, that hasn't been said before. The Godfather is a masterpiece of a movie; the story is pulled off brilliantly with an incredible cast. There's no wonder Al Pacino's career sky rocketed from this performance, however, Marlon Brando is clearly the most dominant actor in this film with his very iconic depiction of Don Vito Corleone; Pacino‚Ä¶  
773  Needless to say, this is a film I have seen a number of times in my life (including on the big screen almost 6 years ago) and as sometime next month I plan on watching The Godfather Epic-the special version that HBO put together of the two movies in chronological order w/ added footage that is like The Godfather Saga from '81 except that the explicit moments were put back in-it made sense for me to finally give this a‚Ä¶  
774 De entre todas las cosas que me gustar√≠a destacar de El Padrino, me detengo solo en el hecho de que cada vez que un hombre llora, parece que le van a acercar un pa√±uelo pero en realidad es un trago. 
775 totally phenomenalone of the best characters development i‚Äôve seenal pacino is so discreet and introverted but managed to get so much range and presence for his charactermaybe a lot of people would disagree but i think it would‚Äôve had so much more impact if it was like 2 hours and more compacti wouldn‚Äôt agree but i can understand people that say it‚Äôs the greatest movie of all time 
776 It insists upon itself.I respect this film more then I actually enjoy it. 
777 I‚Äôm not really sure what to say about this film that hasn‚Äôt been said by anyone before.¬†A movie filled with brilliant acting performances and some incredible dialogue. A very interesting story, delving into the crime world and it‚Äôs control. It‚Äôs a masterpiece but we all knew that already.¬†It‚Äôs a slow burner which works for a film like this. Sadly for me I struggle to focus with slow burners but this film did well to keep me interested and I really enjoyed it 
778  My friend over @Tales.From.The.Kino on Instagram roused my curiosity when stating in a recent review that the film industry nowadays values the star/starlet rather than the might and tenacity of the story.¬†When you have films that utilize the players as your draw in marketing you know that the producers behind said film were banking on just that aspect. If the film turns out satisfactory to the masses that‚Äôs quant, but the bank shot is your Chris Hemsworth, Tom Cruise,‚Ä¶

781  It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's "The Godfather" for what might be the 7th or 8th time. I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So,‚Ä¶  
782  AN OFFER YOU CAN‚ÄôT REFUSEThis is my single most anticipated film of all time. My hype for it was immense, and even that is an understatement. Even through the unfair expectations I had for this film, this went above and beyond that. This has got to be one of the most poignant and special experiences of my life. This is truly one of the greatest triumphs in cinematic history and maybe the most legendary picture of all time. Cinema‚Ä¶

787 Week 31: a trilogy - part 1this video sums up how i feel about the filmI simply do not understand why this is one of the highest-rated films of all time. Maybe I‚Äôm just dumb, or maybe my expectations were too high (or a combination of both), but I found this incredibly confusing and boring.Mutuals if you love this movie I‚Äôd love to know why. I‚Äôm not saying that in a confrontational way I‚Äôm genuinely curious what makes this film as adored as it is. 
788  Well everyone I made it to 1000 movies on LB, and what a groundbreaking movie to watch for this milestone. It may be weird to see it at only number 18 in my favorites list but I assure you it will probably rise the more I think about it. The Godfather is a cinematic achievement. The story, the acting, and the cinematography are all fantastic. The movie was honestly never really boring and kept me invested throughout the entire runtime.‚Ä¶  
789 al pacino‚Äôs impact in this needs to be studied he really had me wanting to be a mafia wife at age 12 
790 my greatest internal conflicts are over why i didn't particularly like  Frances Ha  or this :x 
791 Always thought it was a great film, but I'll never understand the people who call it the greatest film. Maybe one day. I don't get immersed in it. I'm not really that invested in it either. But there's many elements that I love, it just doesn't come together as a total thing that I love. Not gonna force it.However, it is Film School 101 for:1. The motherfucking rule of thirds2. How to do a motherfucking fade 
792 I really wish I would've waited to see this magnificent piece of work¬†until now. High school was strange for everyone and it was in high school that I had my first viewing of The Godfather. I was underwhelmed. I thought it was overrated. I wondered why Marlon Brando was talking like that. I was an idiot. I don't understand how I could've possibly been underwhelmed... And I never was much of a contrarian so there must've been a reason. I don't know. I'm genuinely angry at my younger self. I even had the audacity to have my letterboxd rating as 3.5 stars. Jesus Christ. 
793 This is a perfect film. Possibly the best film ever made. 
794  Je suis bien conscient qu'il n'y a rien d'original √† tripper sur The Godfather. Greta Gerwig a d'ailleurs cr√©√© un excellent gag sur l'amour que de ¬´¬†trop¬†¬ª nombreux hommes portent √† ce film!Et pourtant... chaque fois que je revois ce chef-d'oeuvre l√©gendaire, j'en ai le souffle coup√©.

The direction is certainly not flashy but the story does not require that, the performance by Brando I think is slightly overrated, but that's just my opinion and‚Ä¶

805 Una de las mayores obras de la historia del cine. Gana much√≠simo ahora que la revisite y me gust√≥ inmensamente m√°s que la primera vez que la vi. Una obra magnanima, con personajes carism√°ticos perfectamente desarrollados, un gui√≥n impecable, un ritmo que hacen que sus 3 horas se pasen volando, una obsesi√≥n por cada detalle de puesta en escena que es BESTIAL. No puedo abarcar en palabras la bestia del cine que es El Padrino. Una de las, si no es la mejor, obra de mafias jam√°s hecha. Muchas ganas de empezar la segunda parte. 
806 For the first time ever, I can notice some chinks in this films incredibly thick armor. I probably never noticed how clumsy the story is at times because I was distracted by world class acting, stunning cinematography, dazzling setpieces and the legendary musical score. And that cat that Godfather pets. 
807 ‚ÄúI'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.‚ÄùI‚Äôm sorry to everyone for waiting all (almost) 24 years of my adult life to finally see this... but I‚Äôm also mad that nobody in those 24 years of my life made me watch it, or told me to watch it.There‚Äôs only one word to describe... everything,¬†in this beautiful film.... LEGENDARY. The acting, score, the writing, everything.... just... legendary.I was dreading the 3 hour run time... but I‚Äôll watch that shit again and again I tell you. 
808  10/10My third watch.Yeah...it really is that good.I haven't seen this for about about eighteen months, and I have avoided a revisit for awhile. I saw it on the big screen last time (one of the best movie experiences of my life) and was worried I wouldn't like it nearly as much a third time around (because I found it pretty disappointing on my first watch and nothing could match up to my second viewing). And, while this‚Ä¶  
809  "I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."The Godfather is a quintessential mafia crime drama. At nearly three hours, it's epic yet intimate at the same time. Marlon Brando was extremely compelling as Vito Corleone. Everytime he was on screen, I was just drawn into his character. Al Pacino was also great in this as Michael Corleone. It's interesting to see how his character began to how he is at the end of the film. The lighting is‚Ä¶  
810  73/100Okay Mom, so I finally saw The Godfather. You and everybody else were right: it's fucking great.

814 Michael returned from Sicily with post nut clarity. 
815 Just realised that the print that is released in Indian theatres isn't the new 4K version, and many scenes that were cut by the Censor Board of India in 1972 were still cut in the version.That means this was the OG version that the Censor Board passed in 1972. Only thing they changed was the sound quality, which was enhanced to Dolby Digital (not Atmos) from a stereoscopic sound.Now I am a bit sad. :(

820  "I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."It's a huge understatement if you're just going to say that The Godfather is a great film. It's so much more than that.

830 Saw it at Metrograph. ‚Äúafter all, we are not communists.‚ÄùSimply fantastic when it comes to plot mechanics, pacing, and form. A three hour movie that swings like jazz and opera; baptism scene is a longer scene than you might think, but has intense rhythm. Yes, it is Michael‚Äôs soul dying officially, but it is also Coppola telling you how the Catholic Church is the beginning of capitalism itself; that the death of men can be ordered in this place like its a Gordon Gekko sales pitch. 
831  Perhaps the first thing that comes to mind for many when they think about cinema, and it is no surprise that Francis Coppola presents us with the greatest reference of the Italian mafia in the seventh art.The film begins by introducing Don Vito Corleone in one of the most famous scenes in cinema. The self-proclaimed leader of the region's mafia receives an acquaintance who begs for justice for his daughter.Throughout the work we note that his power and‚Ä¶  
832 The Godfather basicamente te mostra que em terra de poder, os princ√≠pios s√£o escassos.

Desde a rebeli√£o entre as fam√≠lias at√© o foco mais pessoal em Michael e seus relacionamentos, Coppola n√£o perde a ess√™ncia desse universo mafioso, dessa caracter√≠stica material, por exemplo, no casamento, onde todos est√£o celebrando, e Don‚Ä¶  
836 i can‚Äôt believe i deprived myself of this movie for so long i‚Äôm such a dumbass 
837 This movie is good‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt get me wrong. But man it is not what I expected it to be. Great acting combined with a great story, but viewing it for the first time today, it just didn‚Äôt move me the way I was expecting it to from what I‚Äôve heard.Yes Marlon Brando & Al Pacino we‚Äôre absolutely terrific. I‚Äôm excited to see what happens in the next Godfather as it‚Äôs apparently one of the best sequels of all time.. hopefully I‚Äôm not let down. 
838  While I still thoroughly enjoyed watching Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather, I can't say that I did for the reasons that many other film buffs do. To be straightforward, I don't think that The Godfather is the masterclass in filmmaking or mafia films that it has always been proclaimed to be.

840 Look, I absolutely do think we as a culture have made The Godfather too important, sacralizing the text (and often misinterpreting it) in ways that have been detrimental. But I also think, especially while actually sitting in front of it: man, that's one hell of a movie.(Blu-ray)

842 michael's sigma male arc in this movie is still untouchable 
843 I just saw this in a theatre. I can't express what that means to me. So, I won't try.As good as movies can be. 
844  My dad was a baby then.The year was 1972. The year was fifty years ago.Black screen. Cue in The Godfather theme.Roll credits. PARAMOUNT PICTURES PRESENTSMARIO PUZO'S   THE GODFATHER On the big screen was the bulldog exterior and the smoked rustled voice of Marlon Brando mumbling his way through incoherent and audibly incomprehensible perfection. Al Pacino's breakout performance launching the titanic star into superstardom and an eternal hall of fame, whose flame burns bright to this day.‚Ä¶  
845 Not me falling asleep to IMDB‚Äôs #2 movie.¬†Watched in theatres for the 50th Anniversary.¬†üò¨ 
846 A magnum opus. A classic. Endlessly quoteworthy. Emotional and powerful.

849 What can I even say about The Godfather that hasn‚Äôt already been said and expounded upon explored in depth and through myriad lens?Some different facet always stands out each watch; this time, the opening conversation and its emotional pay-off, an interaction that I felt perfectly encapsulated Vito as the Don, compared to Michael‚Äôs Old Testament ruthlessness. That baptism sequence is cinematic perfection.¬†I wish all three-hour movies aspired to be paced as immaculately as this; the runtime just glides by. 
850 FINALLY! I have seen it. The one and only. The holy grail of cinema. Let me tell you, the hype is real. The story, so rich. The score, hauntingly beautiful. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, WOW. And bonus, I can now understand and appreciate the hundreds of references and quotes spread across pop culture."I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."Featured in my BLACK BLACK BLACK posters

852  Has there ever been a better run by an actor than Al Pacino‚Äôs right out of the gate streak from his first performance in Panic in Needle Park through Dog Day Afternoon? It really doesn‚Äôt seem like it.

856 9.3/10 AOne of cinemas greatest classics, The Godfather did feel a bit dated, but was saved by the impeccable acting, story and screenplay, and score. However, I do feel that Micheal Coreleones character development and arc was rushed through, as well as the presence of a few missed opportunities.viewing details:¬†the omerta edition on an HDTV with Charlie Bettingler

862 I first saw The Godfather  about 10 years ago and a revisit was well overdue, in fact it felt like was I was witnessing the film for the first time. My feelings have changed dramatically towards this masterpiece, I absolutely adore this film. Shot beautifully and masterfully acted, the characters are some of the best to be displayed on film - just perfect. 
863 My first viewing, yes I'm late, yes I deserve to be punished.Nothing I say will add anything new you haven't heard before.  It all starts with the long wedding sequence that completely sucked me in, and left me hanging on every word, every move made by the Corleone family. Every scene felt so real, so very truly authentic.Immediately after the film ended I replayed the whole wedding sequence again astonished at just how natural everything felt.This is essential viewing for everyone, i am just glad I finally took the time to watch this true masterpiece! 
864 Hot take but this is one of the best movies of all time 
865  While it's still in theaters (you know, until The Batman waltzes in and kicks it off the deluxe screens), I decided to take a look at the 50th (jesus!) anniversary of The Godfather.

868 I cannot believe what I have just witnessed. Honestly, the film is way too long, as is anything over 1 minute. The hack of a director, Coppola, should look back to the roots of film and find out how to make a REAL film. Keep it short, keep it silent, and keep it black and white. I can't believe I even sat through this. Garbage.

883  It‚Äôs not often you meet a movie lover who hasn‚Äôt seen The Godfather - yet here I am! Finally got round to watching it after 36 years on this planet, and I loved every minute of it. Francis Ford Coppola delivers a cinematic masterpiece with an absolutely stellar cast. Marlon Brando is of course excellent and iconic as Vito Corleone, but the star without doubt is Al Pacino as his son Michael. Other highlights include Robert Duvall and James Caan‚Ä¶  
884  Based on Mario Puzo‚Äôs crime novel The Godfather (1969), which Paramount Pictures secured as a still unfinished 60-page manuscript for a measly $12,500 with an $80,000 option, Francis Ford Coppola‚Äôs traditionally filmed and stylized¬†The Godfather (1972) forever altered the crime genre and gangster subgenre with the introduction of ‚Äúfamily‚Äù as a motivator for criminal activities against those purely pursuing personal gain.This story about the pursuit of health and wealth for the sake of familial bonds, many of which extend‚Ä¶

894 1972 RankedPhysically Owned FilmsNo need to spend a lot of time talking in detail about all the wonderful elements of this film; you already know them. But one thing to say - I believe this film is so immersive because of its character driven drama. Coppola does a tremendous job showcasing fascinating character arcs for multiple characters, and our time with them just flies by.Impressive, well-deserving of 5 stars, yet somehow not quite as good as its sequel.

902 I love everything about this movie. It elevates the book, puts on an acting clinic, and is shot more memorably than anything else before or after. And the music is so damned emotive!The Godfather might be the most quotable movie of all time. It's funny (leave the gun...take the canolis), grim (tell Michael it was only business), and dramatic (our true enemy has yet to reveal himself). If you haven't seen this yet, it's not just hype. Check it out! 
903 Come over here kid, you'll learn something. You never know, you might have to cook for 20 guys someday. You start with a little oil, then fry some garlic.

906  The Godfather masterfully trims the fat on Puzo's text (published three years earlier in 1969) which I just recently finished reading. My third or fourth viewing of the film, I was happy to have the additional info that the novel provided.

909 After 2,500+ movies, I've now finally seen The Godfather. Lives up to its status, with its iconic performances, exciting filmmaking, and rich characters. I don't think long gangster epics are necessarily my thing, but this is the pinnacle. 
910 I've been meaning to rewatch this after finishing the book and after doing so I can now say that this is not only one of the greatest films ever made, it is also one of the greatest adaptations ever made. Nothing I can say that hasn't been said already, all of it is true. 
911 guys am i literally don corleone??we have so much in common, i also have a wriggly cat that lays on my lap while i take care of business (maths homework) 
912 the godfather is a landmark of american cinema and remains an enduring classic. from the opening scene, you're drawn into the world of the corleone family and are engaged right up to the very last shot. the performances are utterly perfect; the cinematography is dark, tasteful and completely captivating and my god james caan's shoulders!!!!!!! 
913  I don't even want to rate this. I don't know how to even compare this to most of the other things I have rated 5 stars, which honestly kind of feels like junk food compared to this. The film takes awhile to get going, but when the movie is good, it's indescribably good. "The Godfather" is truly a chilling analogy of crime in the world with superb filmmaking and outstanding performances.SCORE: 97% üíØ (NEAR PERFECT)STANDOUT PERFORMANCE: MARLON BRANDO‚Ä¶  
914 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  I have been alive for 23 years and have grown up watching everything reference this film. Now I have finally watched it. Holy shit! There's a lot I can say, but I think it's probably all been said before. Marlon Brando's fantastic. Al Pachino's excellent and also very handsome when he was younger. Also that baptism execution scene, is a whole lot more brutal than how it was described to me by my mom. I get why this is such a good film now

924  While I'm sure that a certain subset of this movie's fans are attracted to the mafia male power fantasy, as mafia stories tend to do, to me, The Godfather is about grief. About grief and love and anger. About the multiple natures of man. About how complex our emotions are. How love is ultimately a double-edged sword, love for those who we cherish and hate for those who have done them harm. How severity coexists next to tenderness and vice-versa.‚Ä¶  
925  I've been meaning to do this for a while and I'm finally getting around to it: drinking Coppola's wine while watching his "Godfather" films. I'm kicking it off by pairing Coppola Wineries' Claret with the first "Godfather" film. I don't know how to properly review a wine.

939 Can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve held onto the DVD to this gem since Spring of 2019 and I just now got around to watching it. Very much worth the wait. It is a certified, Chef‚Äôs Kiss.¬†I‚Äôve only got one more movie until New Years. This surprise movie is regarded as one of the best sequels of all time and it‚Äôs to one of my favorite movies. Take a guess. 
940 why do people make music? we‚Äôve literally reached the peak of music and it‚Äôs love theme ‚Äúfrom the godfather‚Äù. 
941 Haven't rewatched. Just making a comment. The family you are born in, your surroundings, your environment has a strong hold on you. However much you try to distance yourself from all that it has a way of pulling you closer eventually. And gradually you end up at the center of everything you wanted to stay away from. Isn't The Godfather all about this universal human phenomenon?

945 wow.... this truly is the godfather of movies.... follow for more Hot Takes..... 
946 So it‚Äôs been 6 years since I first watched this and I think I liked it a lot more this time. I feel like back in the day I was just knocking imdb top 250‚Äôs off my list and did not give this movie the attention it deserved, it really is an amazing movie! 
947  Short ReviewRepositioned in: Francis Ford Coppola RankedI don't know what to say. After rewatching this, many, many years after I originally saw it, I still can't see a masterpiece. I see a very well made film for sure and with the knowledge of cinema I have gained over the course of the past years I can now admire certain aspects more than before. The acting, cinematography, music, directing and script all seem near flawless except for minor mishaps‚Ä¶  
948 No better family to spend the holiday with. 
949 this was good but no shrek (2001) 
950 Ah, the Godfather. Just one of those things with a gargantuan reputation that somehow lives up to it. 
951 Rewatch üö®I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that there is 0 things wrong with this film. Every single second of every single scene is worth it and crafted magnificently. If you say this film is bad, then what I say to that is you simply didn‚Äôt watch it close enough, because you might‚Äôve saw the painting but you missed the art. 
952 good film I guess but unrealistic because as a member of the mccluskey family I can confidently say a mccluskey would never be a cop 
953  It‚Äôs been 50 years since The Godfather first came out, and exactly 2 years since I first watched (the majority of) it. You know the drill, a 16-year-old that doesn‚Äôt understand complex filmmaking, watching a movie about a topic he never related to. You can imagine what state my mind was in after sitting through it. But I took the clever and mature way out by simply avoiding it for as long as possible trying to forget about it until‚Ä¶  
954 Clemenza is the best part of it by a mile.I think I‚Äôd love hanging out with him and with Fredo, who is actually a really cool guy 
955 *holding michael in my arms like a little cat and singing to him* myyy babyyy myyyyy babyyyyy you‚Äôre my babyyy say it to meeee 
956 Coppola's least formally interesting work with his pet fraternal themes, but also, probably his sturdiest. Can't go wrong with that cast. Willis's cinematography makes every single frame iconic based on color pallate alone. 
957 Michael Corleone: she's hystericalGuy behind me: you're pretty funny yourselfAnyway it was so fun watching this iconic movie in a giant theater with an enthusiastic audience. 
958 i can no longer say i‚Äôve never watched the godfather rip 
959 Rewatched since I finished reading the novel recently. Of course with the medium being more expansive, the novel added more depth to the story and in a way recontextualising the film for me in this rewatch. Also it's safe to say that this is probably the greatest casting in cinema. Every character just click into their roles to the point that it became impossible to think of any alternatives. What I love about cinema summed up in 175 minutes. 
960 This had been on my blind spot list for so long it became something of a challenge to myself. I built up a whole mythology around me not having seen The Godfather. I had to save it for that perfect moment.That perfect moment wound up being at 11pm on a Thursday night before a friend‚Äôs wedding as I was painting my nails and eating Doritos on my bedroom floor and thought out of nowhere ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to watch The Godfather.‚ÄùIn the words of Marvin Schwarz: ‚ÄúWhat a picture.‚Äù 
961 ACONTECEU AMIGOS!!¬†AQUELE QUE ERA O MAIS TEMIDO DE TODOS!! ASSISTI!! E AMEI üëèüëèüëèüëèsinto que da pr√≥xima vez que assistir esse filme eu vou ter que estar de batom vermelho, bebendo whisky e fumando um cigarrinho‚Ä¶(al pacino se vc n√£o √© o cara mais gostoso do mundo eu n√£o sei quem h√° de ser) 
962 üé¨üé≠"The Godfather" is a cinematic masterpiece that deserves all the accolades it has received. Marlon Brando's iconic performance as the Don will leave you speechless, while the film's intricate plot will keep you on the edge of your seat. If you haven't seen it yet, be prepared for a rollercoaster of emotions, and remember to never refuse an offer you can't refuse. It's a 4.5 out of 5 for me, and that's not just because the Don is watching.üé¨üé≠ 
963  Kubrick may be right and it might just have the best cast ever and could be the best movie ever made. But, one personal gripe I've always had with it is its use of oranges (my favorite fruit/healthy food) as a foreshadowing of death. Why is that? If I was Coppola, I'd have used eggs instead. Hitchcock might have too since he detested them exactly as much. They're the true food of death. Oranges are the food of life. For‚Ä¶  
964  Coppola has created a masterpiece here, from the writing, to the meticulous and beautiful cinematography that has meaning behind every shot, to the performances that blow you away every dang time, I just can‚Äôt get enough of this film.¬†Sure it‚Äôs slow at some parts but it‚Äôs just so mesmerizing, so many great themes, so many great characters, so many great action sequences, I honestly don‚Äôt know how you could find this movie boring.Love, family, death, grief, sorrow, revenge,‚Ä¶  
965 Empec√© el a√±o de la mejor manera, viendo El Padrino en familia comiendo sorrentinos de jam√≥n y queso. 
966  3 and a half years¬†For 3 and a half years I‚Äôve owned the godfather on dvd. The full trilogy. It‚Äôs become a running joke that I‚Äôve never seen the godfather. And for the simple reason that I knew I would love it. I needed to save it, in a glass emergency box and break it when I needed it most. ¬†And so in my darkest hour, I decided to break that curse today. But I was too lazy‚Ä¶  
967 yeah, seeing it in a theater is still somehow kind of revelatory. the scale of Brando's performance changes, you can see the small choices as clearly as the bolder ones. and yet the older i get the more it becomes Pacino's movie entirely, his performance between these first two movies may be the pinnacle of American screen acting. 
968 all i heard was pasta pasta lasagna mama mia 
969 Marlon Brando che figo della madonna 
970  The Godfather‚Äôs the kinda film where you can‚Äôt help but feel jealous at the sheer amalgamation of procured talent on display. It‚Äôs amazing to see such masters of their craft breeze through their career bests while firing on all cylinders with methodical proficiency. The bar was set stratospherically high 50 years ago when The Godfather¬†released, and as we all know there‚Äôs not one technical element that‚Äôs not in the league of ageless finesse. For a film to assert itself as‚Ä¶  
971  It feels like a crime to say that I believe The Godfather is imperfect ‚Äî or more accurately, flawed*. But moreso it feels like a miracle that such a troubled production, and what is essentially the first major opportunity given to an indie filmmaker, a story spanning an entire decade¬†turned out to be hailed as perhaps the greatest American film ever made. Emblematic of the New Hollywood movement, putting on display some outstanding writing and brilliant directing.¬†There‚Äôs something new‚Ä¶  
972  Hello people, it is me, the very sad sad individual known as Driplix and today I will be discussing on The Godfather and how it broke my heart.First off, what the fuck is that poster? Why is this old man looking so depressively at the cat?!!?!?! IT'S A FUCKING CAT, EAT IT!!!! IT'S NOT YOUR DEAD GRANDMA FOR GOD'S SAKE! Also why the fuck is it so BLACK?!?!?! I CANNOT SEE THE OTHER PEOPLE, THAT'S NOT WHAT MOVIE POSTERS‚Ä¶  
973 I don‚Äôt know, some movie called The Godfather or something. 
974  Part of the Composed by Nino Rota collection.Rota was genius at repurposing a melody originally presented in one musical genre into a completely whackadoo different context. Sometimes he would reuse the same melody in 2 or 3 or 4 different films. In the back of Richard Dyer's musical biography of Rota he has an entire section devoted to listing the number of times Rota melodically quoted HIMSELF in later works. In total Dyer counted 52 sources reused in 75‚Ä¶  
975 I watched The Godfather for the first time.It went pretty well.(You can skip this video, it's low key ass lmao) 
976  I mean, its not even really just a 'film' any more is it?It's now more myth or legend than lightweight piece of entertainment fluff. Every frame has seeped into our collective consciousness as pure artistry, every line of dialogue poetry, every character elevated to a level of notoriety usually only associated with deities.But more than that, more than any other wannabe crime/gangster 'epic', FFC gives us 'family' like never seen before. Others may have more bloodshed, more violence,‚Ä¶  
977 I will be eternally grateful I was able to experience this beautiful piece of art in theatres.

980  If you‚Äôve ever stumbled upon a ‚Äútop 100 movies of all time‚Äù list or something along those lines, chances are you saw The Godfather extremely high up on that list. And whilst some of the films that pop up in these conversations time and time again are arguably undeserving of their status, nothing deserves it‚Äôs seat at the table in cinema history more than Francis Ford Coppola‚Äôs 1972 adaptation of Mario Puzo‚Äôs best-selling novel.There‚Äôs nothing I can say about‚Ä¶  
981 I like that one scene when he's a gangster 
982 the way I thought this film couldn‚Äôt get any better then I watched it in the cinema 
983  The 50th-anniversary 4k restoration showing at the Broadway Cinema in Nottingham. A film I have seen a few times but not for at least 20 years, it was a pleasure to see this on the big screen, made all the more special by the fact that I was accompanied by my son who had never seen it before.The thing is The Godfather is one of those films that I think wannabee Cineasts take for granted, it's just always there,‚Ä¶  
984  TW: Brief but graphic animal violence and depictions of domestic abuse."Leave the gun. Take the cannoli."Been itching to revisit The Godfather trilogy for a while now because I've only seen them once before and it was ages ago.

Coppola and Puzo's (Whose book the film‚Ä¶  
985 what I gathered after nearly 3 hours of this is that we need to launch a study on how badly al pacino aged so we can make sure that never happens to anyone else ever again 
986 italian dudes rock 
987 I watched this series like 4 or 5 years ago for first time. I liked Part 2 more than part 1. But now watching again, my opinion changes. It's very hard choose between them. But the subtle changes within the characters are much better in part 1."keep your friends close and your enemies closer."You have to look part 2 close but part 1 closer.Only don't tell me you don't like it. Because it insults my intelligence and makes me very angry. 
988  Didn‚Äôt actually rewatch but I just had a realization on the main imperfect thing to me about the movie, the reason for the missing half star. I always needed more between the wedding segment and the hospital segment- more to establish reasoning for Michael to assume leadership. Because as it stands, it always feels to me slightly contrived and random that he‚Äôs suddenly willing to change his life completely. And for the whole series to hinge on the emotions‚Ä¶

991 Watched this with my two youngest, ages 18 and 19. The 19-year-old asked for it because something he watched had a Godfather tribute. Such a well put together movie, I never turn down an opportunity to watch it. Such amazing acting on display. 
992 THE Godfather, true masterpiece.It‚Äôs not personal Letterboxd. It‚Äôs strictly cinephilia

994 I mean, what can you even say?It‚Äôs unrelentingly tragic and darkly beautiful and perfectly performed and musically enchanting, and at the end of it all I‚Äôm left unsatisfied, knowing that I will never truly know if Don Corleone is a heavy chewing tobacco user or just has a really severe underbite.The Godfather Trilogy podcast episode 
995 I mean it‚Äôs marvellous. Out of all the hyped up classics there is, I put off watching this one the most. But I see it, I see how perfect it is. It‚Äôs got such a powerful set of characters with such an enticing plot, and although long it didn‚Äôt feel like it dragged in the slightest. Epic in its quality, all the aspects of film come together perfectly to create this brilliant flick.See new and much better review here¬† 
996  Until recently, I had lived under a heavy, wet blanket of shame --- for decades --- simply because I had never seen Francis Ford Coppola‚Äôs first two ‚ÄúGodfather‚Äù films. ‚ÄúThe Godfather‚Äù (1972) and ‚ÄúThe Godfather Part II‚Äù (1974) are landmarks in American film.

1005  "Tell Mike it was just business".An iconic film, featuring a towering performance from Marlon Brando as Don Corleone, the titular Godfather. Surprisingly not a showy role, but one full of subtle tics and shades. His quiet performance in the tomato garden is astounding in its execution.This is an epic story of family, loyalty and betrayal which plays out in the aftermath of World War II.

1011 "I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."My favorite movie of all-time showed up at my local theater for the 50th Anniversary. It was an offer I couldn't refuse. There are other new films I wanted to check out, but once this popped up, those movies became irrelevant. It feels so good to finally see this incredible piece of cinema on the big screen. I hope The Godfather Part II gets the same treatment in a couple of years. I will be there. 
1012 Favorite shot this time around is the one where a guy in Sicily is eating bread alone under a single lightbulb 
1013  finally caved in. the godfather has always been less of a film for me and more of a concept, an enigma and less anything i can function as a piece of cinema. its always been the film which i have been shamed into not watching, the film which is regarded as the all important piece of american cinema. yet when i finally watch this the meaning behind these words kinda all make sense. the great american tragedy is set on‚Ä¶  
1014  78/100(was a 64/100)The great American tragedy. This is not a film of villains and heroes, nor is it a film of moral ambiguity or grayness; instead, it is a film of hollowness--a tragedy of seismic proportions wherein every single character is unable to live a fulfilling life. What Coppola does here, that I hadn‚Äôt understood before, is that he presents us with a world of pain and suffering where nothing gets better and there is only death--that world being‚Ä¶

1016 Now I understand why this is considered by most to be the best film of all time. The acting is top notch and the storytelling is amazing. Michael and Don Vito are such great leads. You truly see Michael‚Äôs character change from sweet man to ruthless boss. There are definitely some slow parts but the highs are so dang high. The ending is just wonderful. I am so excited to watch the second part soon! 
1017 Wow. Just WOW. I feel like I wasn‚Äôt ready for this. I was ready to say that it was overhyped and didn‚Äôt deserve the praise. WAS I WRONG. Seriously if you haven‚Äôt seen this yet and you claim to be a cinephile, do yourself a favor and watch it right away. It‚Äôs been a while since I was genuinely FLOORED by the end of a film.

1019 I've decided that any boy I date must possess a deep and abiding love for The Godfather. That'll be my way of figuring out just how much taste he's got.My original review still sums up my full thoughts on the film. Needless to say, it was just as elegant and absorbing the second time around.

Im not a fan of what i guess would be considered "organized crime" movies, so im actually surprised i liked this more than i disliked it. i'd say my biggest issue is that even without the long runtime i just felt like it dragged throughout the whole film and a lot of it could have been cutout. there was a lot of scenes where i was pretty confused by what the point of them was, ¬†i feel like all the‚Ä¶

It's an amazing work of art. And I think this movie is so highly rated because it is a rare case where it is a movie every cinephile can like, either if you have a "filmbro taste" or a "pretentious taste".Anyways I don't think I have anything to say about this masterpiece that hasnt been said already for other people.(Part 2 tomorrow perhaps)

The story is very intimate and simple and it‚Äôs beautiful the family is close and real and loving and it feels like watching a real family it‚Äôs great. I don‚Äôt have a favourite part of this movie or anything it‚Äôs just 5 stars across the board 
1034  Happy 50th anniversary to The Godfather!What can I say? The Godfather is one of the most groundbreaking and influential movies of all time. It has been reference and parodied endlessly to the point someone who hasn‚Äôt seen it will recognize that it‚Äôs from The Godfather.The film is very well shot and has a great sense of scale. The aesthetic defiantly captures the 40s and 50s with each set piece feeling authentic. Not to mention Nino Rota‚Äôs soundtrack elevates‚Ä¶  
1035 A monumental epic that feels remarkably satisfying on first watch, interweaving so much tension and great sequences throughout its length. A truly phenomenal ensemble anchors Coppola's taut direction and the cinematography in Dolby was absolutely exquisite to behold. A movie I'm honestly blown away on too much to write a lot about it; it's rare a film is hyped up your whole life and then exceeds your expectations. The Godfather does though, feeling so ahead of its time that it makes so much sense how it radically altered the course of Hollywood. Elegant and entertaining, this is what the movies are made for. 
1036  Para nosotros, los Corleone son los buenos y las familias rivales son los malos; este es el ambicioso concepto central sobre el que gira toda la pel√≠cula: logra separar a los buenos de los malos en un mundo construido y poblado enteramente por malos.El tema de la familia es obvio y a√∫n as√≠ interesante, pero la realidad es que es solo la base de su trama principal que es la ineludibilidad del destino de uno o una mezcla de‚Ä¶  
1037 Watched in the cinema as part of the 50 year celebration of this classic. Striking images, nuanced performances, and it still holds up pretty well. Remarkably watchable and the three hour runtime a breeze to sit through. 
1038  The godfather a classic. 50 years ago it was released and getting to see this on the big screen was brilliant.¬†This film has had lot said about it but from start to it end is just brilliant.

Nadie lo sabe, esta pel√≠cula sigue generando sorpresas en quienes la amamos. 
1041  Soooooo much better on rewatch wow this is a masterpiece. The acting, directing, writing etc. Its all just amazing arguable perfect. I could even say this is in my top 4 but I'm having a problem with the my favourite movies list. I feel like my top 4 looks so basic as in jusr movies claimed the best oat put into it so I'm gonna make some changes. I will put 2001 at number 5, I still think of it‚Ä¶

1043  JB's review: 8/10"Loved Al Pacino's character." Agreed, I love the way Michael grows and I'm so used to action as pointless filler that I wasn't expecting The Godfather to be so emotionally charged and inward. All the babies and home cooking certainly add to that feeling. This is truly intelligent, rich-beyond-belief writing that expects an attentive audience. Is there a more satisfying final shot in cinema? So effortless in its flawlessness, it's always apparent that Coppola has complete control‚Ä¶  
1044 This shit is amazing¬†Ye it‚Äôs mainstream or ‚ÄúFilmbro‚Äù material but idk this movie is like an anime arc¬†It‚Äôs perfectThe best movie of all time (on a technical level)Michael Corleone = Greatest character in cinemaMichael‚Äôs character arc is as good as someone like Light Yagami‚Äôs arcGet Sonny get some black forces 
1045 A masterclass in filmmaking, acting, and storytelling. But what else can I say about The Godfather that hasn't already been said?Cheers to Francis Ford Coppola.

1049 Pretty good 
1050 Can't get over it, no matter how many times i've seen it 
1051 Wow - I just watched the Godfather part 1. I already knew it was going to be perfect because of Al Pacino... Everything about the film is just amazing. The directing, editing and acting are just on point. Every day I am watching one of the godfather trilogy! Brilliant film - I have realised how many pop culture references are drawn from this one film. 
1052  This was a major blind spot in my cinema experience corrected. Going in, I had seen the parodies, so I was familiar with Brando's menacing whisper-mumble schtick. I knew that this would be dripping with machismo. What I didn't expect was the overwhelming sadness that lies just beneath the surface for virtually every character in the film. The Godfather¬†is far from celebratory about patriarchy and masculine power structures (which was a real relief). In fact, it shows how men can‚Ä¶  
1053  Throughout the beginning, I felt something extraordinary. I felt I was in the movie. I felt I was part of the film‚Äôs universe, I was there at the wedding, I was there at every meeting, at every kill, at every family gathering. The film feels real, the characters feel real, I feel I can surround myself in this world and observe this story, this family and their business.¬†There‚Äôs a reason this movie is seen as one of the greatest‚Ä¶  
1054  This is still one of the best films ever made. The cast is great with Marlon Brando able to display so much charisma while also being menancing. A young Al Pacino was the biggest standout to me just like when I saw the movie for the first time.¬†It‚Äôs almost like a dark fairy tale about how one character falls from glory as they are trying to fix what the sins of the family has created while another character is‚Ä¶  
1055 Top 100: HereFrick! If I keep watching all these amazing films Robots might drop out of Top 20. But yeah this was pretty fricking spectacular. ¬†I will probably watch part 2 soon. 
1056  Hey guys. This is not really a log. I just wanted to say I am saying goodbye to movies for atleast a couple of years because I am going to do something where I don't need distractions. It's really tough because I love cinema so much but right now I have to let it go. So, my request is I have 7 days left. I want to possibly watch everything I can before I give up on movies for quite‚Ä¶  
1057 This film represents the absolute ethos of what i love in great cinema; this one most completely embodies the romance of going to the moviesRarely is a film this flawless in its execution, technical aspects and performances. This is a 3 hour epic masterpieces that never treads wrongly in its entire running time. From the first gloomily lit frame of "I believe in America" to its final shattering image of the door closing on Kay's distraught face and every indelible occurrence in between, Francis Ford Coppola's magnum opus is a feat of film making that will (hopefully) still be watched 100 years from now. 
1058 FINALLY watched this for the first time after too many years to count and it‚Äôs safe to say it just became my favorite movie of all time. Completely mesmerizing and utterly engrossing from the first frame to the last. Total perfection nuff said 
1059 I have witnessed cinema.¬†9.8/10 
1060 Happy Thanksgiving. Only flaws in this are Pacino's absurdly long lasting black eye and Sunny's missed punch. Other than that it's a perfect masterpiece. 
1061 pretty good 
1062 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  look how they massacred my boy @ Sonny  
1063 a fine piece of cinema with excellent direction,performances and an absolutely amazing score but somehow I expected more? is this really the best film in the entire world? well not to me at least...the scenario lacks of soul & depth in my opinion. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino were iconic to say the least. 
1064 Pour vrai, que dire, √† part "wow"? 
1065 I loved when Vito said ‚Äúmnnmnnmmnn mnnmnnnm, mnmnnmmnnnmm‚Äù 
1066  Me: I never have time for anything! All my free time just goes away and I have NO IDEA how it happens.Also Me: Time to watch The Godfather!I liked The Godfather a lot the first time I saw it, but I had a lot of complaints. My main complaints were with the pacing and length because when I saw this I had barely seen any movies and I wasn't used to "long" movies. I truly believe that certain‚Ä¶  
1067  The Godfather is one of those films I never wanted to write about, because the last thing the world needs is another white guy's opinion about one of cinema's most acclaimed masterpieces. Yet here we are, because being consistent isn't among the things I'm particularly known for. But hey, at least it's not going to be another "best movie ever" circle jerk. Here's the thing, I never loved The Godfather. I love mob films, but there was always something about‚Ä¶  
1068 This is my 1000th logged film on letterboxd!! I thought it should be something special so here l am with The Godfather. Marlon Brando did terrible and Francis Ford Coppola cannot direct for pennies. Thank you & good night. 
1069  The few "perfect" films to ever been released are so perfect in every aspect that each scene almost feels like a masterpiece on its own. In the case of Coppola's revolutionary¬†The Godfather, this statement holds especially true. Phenomenal and sheer brilliance in every aspect that cannot be matched by modern "cinema", Coppola's The Godfather¬†is cinematic perfection in every aspect of filmmaking. From performances delivered by an astonding ensemble cast, to Nina Rota's breathtakingly soaring and epic musical score to Coppola's‚Ä¶  
1070  The Godfather (1972) is a masterpiece that I recently rewatched for the first time in a long time on Paramount+. The storyline follows an American mafia family with a Godfather who is a direct descendant from Italy. As the father gets older and close to dying and handing down his power within the family he fields a series of asks, favors and political placement requests for power within the underground world.This movie is directed by Francis Ford Coppola (Apocalypse‚Ä¶  
1071 The Goodmovie 
1072 Obvisouly amazing! The dialogue and cinemotography was great, especially the opening scene. It was such a good introduction to Vito Corleone. The acting was amazing, Marlon Brando and Al Pacino stand out a lot. The downfall of Al Pacino's character is written perfectly. The soundtrack was phenomenal, definetly my favourite bit. I did find some parts confusing as I found it impossible to keep track of characters names. I constantly found myself asking "who the fuck is this guy?" Did just read a summary though and it now makes perfect sense. Overall, flawlessley written and can't wait for part 2. 
1073 A beautiful family drama where the father grapples with business and morals mixed with a coming of age story of one of his sons and the pressures of becoming a man and leader of the family. 
1074  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna make him an offer he can‚Äôt refuse‚Äù¬†This is the best movie of all time. This movie is actually flawless, the acting is incredible, the script/screenplay is amazing, the characters are fantastic, the score is amazing, the story telling is amazing, if you have seen the film I want you to say one thing wrong with this movie, the only criticism I‚Äôve seen for this is that the pacing is to slow and it‚Äôs boring, yes it‚Äôs slow‚Ä¶  
1075  I did it, I can finally say I‚Äôve watched The Godfather and that I LOVE IT (I mean how can I not when within the first 5 minutes Marlon Brando is shown petting a kitten)¬†this has always been one of my parents favorites so I always knew of it but never actually got around to watching it myself. after watching Goodfellas, I asked them what they would recommend next and nearly in sync they both said ‚ÄúTHE GODFATHER‚Äù and‚Ä¶  
1076  Holds up exactly the same on rewatch. In my eyes, the greatest film ever created. It‚Äôs not just a perfect film, it‚Äôs THE perfect film. Not much to say that hasn‚Äôt already been said.¬†Everyone knows about The Godfather and it‚Äôs on everyone‚Äôs best films of all time list for a reason. It‚Äôs just that good. More than 50 years have passed by and it somehow holds up incredibly well even compared to modern films.¬†Even though it has a‚Ä¶  
1077  Deserves all of the praise it gets, honestly.This isn't just one of the greatest mob films of all time, but also one of the most introspective and influential works of art ever created by us humans as a species. It's incredible how much of a cinematic accomplishment it is in terms of its exceptional cinematography, profound acting, intricate dialogue, and the increasingly swelling score along with its brilliantly-written story and characters.In spite of a few overly dramatised moments‚Ä¶  
1078 Trigger warning: Italians, gabbagool 
1079  Okay, I get it. I update this with a new review pretty much every day and have watched nearly 1000 films, yet you may notice that there isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúrewatched‚Äù logo next to this film. I‚Äôve watched so many movies even I struggle to keep track of what I haven‚Äôt watched, but the biggest hole in my cinematic endeavours is that I have never actually sat down and watched The Godfather. My friend once said to get to 1000 films‚Ä¶  
1080 i watched this because i have a reallyyyy good attention span and i‚Äôm reallyyyyyy good at watching long movies,it‚Äôs actually what I‚Äôm known for 
1081 Is it true?No.The slow and winding descent of a man becoming a devil incarnate. A film that transcends generations and genres, instead implanting into the world‚Äôs DNA. The Godfather¬†is¬†so ubiquitous with culture, it‚Äôs power is inescapable. For years, I wondered why. I enjoyed the film but was not enamored like so many around me. Seeing it in a theater forced me to understand. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôve been baptized and born again. As perfect as films can get, and then some. 
1082 Tudo bem que n√£o √© dif√≠cil criar empatia por um vil√£o e os √∫ltimos anos t√£o a√≠ pra demonstrar isso, mas poucos atores na hist√≥ria conseguiram criar uma vulnerabilidade t√£o pungente sobre um personagem t√£o mal√©fico como o Marlon Brando com o Vito Corleone nas cenas imediatamente posteriores √† morte do Sonny. 
1083 üíØ100%Yeah seeing this in a 4K theater was an absolute treasure. I‚Äôm actually a little upset that this wasn‚Äôt my first time watching it, because imagine seeing this for the first time in a theater. That‚Äôs be awesome. 
1084 My mom was snoring through the movie (her 5000th watch basically) until she saw and remembered Diane Keaton was in it and then she just sat there with her eyes wide open. 
1085 My Fourth Watch:(Rewatched in the cinema for its 50th anniversary re-release)Wow! Truly one of the greatest cinema experiences of my entire life. This film is perfection personified. I really wish I had something new to bring to the table in terms of discussion for this film but I really don‚Äôt. Instead, I‚Äôm just going to tell you stuff you already knew: Brando is legendary, Pacino is a revelation and seeing the progression of his character, Michael Corleone is truly something to behold, the cinematography is gorgeous and the script is magnificent; would you expect any less from ‚ÄòThe Godfather‚Äô ? 
1086 Creo que no voy a poder superar nunca esta experiencia de haberla visto en el cine, es la pel√≠cula m√°s grande que existe. Que la dejen para siempre en la cartelera. 
1087 Yeah okay. It‚Äôs as good as they say. 
1088  A cena crucial da trilogia "O Poderoso Chef√£o" √© a conversa que Michael tem com o seu pai no jardim, ainda no primeiro filme. Aparentemente, o drama de Michael reside no confronto entre a vontade de n√£o pertencer ao universo criminoso da fam√≠lia e a avalanche de acontecimentos que o leva para dentro do redemoinho familiar, do qual ele gostaria de sair. No entanto, na cena da conversa, numa disposi√ß√£o bergmaniana de faces e reflexos, fica claro que ter um‚Ä¶  
1089 al pacino was actually so very sick and twisted so deranged so insane for just going around looking like that 
1090 what can I say? I could spend one hundred more hours watching these big men drink out of their small cups 
1091  An offer I can‚Äôt refuse.¬†To no surprise there is everything to unpack with this mobster juggernaut. An ‚Äúall-time great work‚Äù feels like an understatement - as much as I still have to digest this behemoth of a film. The Godfather¬†is one of the most powerful¬†pieces of cinema I‚Äôve had the opportunity of viewing. It‚Äôs a patiently constructed saga of heritage and family, wrapped in the mise-en-sc√®ne‚Äôs grandeur; the sheer presence of the engulfing lightwork, elegant production, and the incredibly‚Ä¶  
1092 What can I say about this that hasn‚Äôt been said so many times? Went in with no knowledge of the events within, came out very pleased with what I saw. I‚Äôd like to know what makes it a perfect 10 for most people.¬†Performances were fantastic along with the writing being phenomenal! 
1093 i FINALLY watched it......yeah the way i'm a sucker for film bro movies is my biggest character flaw.....also it's crazy to watch the godfather at age 19 because you realize how many sayings/cultural references/etc you've been hearing your whole life are actually attributed to the godfather and aren't just colloquial englishEdit 3yrs later I want to delete this but feel like I can‚Äôt 
1094  i was actually somewhat nervous going into this film. it's such a mythic piece of cinema; it's so entrenched in our culture itself. it's long runtime is also a bit of a drawback, but thankfully every shot and scene was important to this broader story of downfall and rising. this is the perfect period piece. the grain of the film, the colors, and the iconic soundtrack‚Äì you're so solidly in this world. the screenplay is fantastic. beyond iconic lines that‚Ä¶  
1095 Was going to write a whole review, but everybody's seen it, and knows it's great. so 
1096  Last Friday, Dutch director Martin Koolhoven showed a couple of scenes from the Godfather is his weekly film-college program at the Dutch public broadcast service. Last weeks subject was American Gangsters, but he quickly dropped everything he planned and went for The Godfather instead. he showed four scenes in which the transformation of Michael Corleone from an outsider to his family to his father's heir. Most of the times, if you see a single scene you watch it and you‚Ä¶  
1097 Uhh wow. It really is one of the best movies ever made. 
1098  "Don Corleone..."If there is a film that will be called the objectively best film of all time, I would absolutely be content with Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather being that candidate. It's THE perfect film; it practically doesn't even feel like a film, more like an experience. It's got everything anyone could ever want in a movie: drama, suspense, justice, Sicilian culture, you name it. The performances are all phenomenal, the cinematography is impeccable, the script, as well as‚Ä¶  
1099 Play the score of this movie at my funeral please and thank you. 
1100 Obviously not the hottest take on this website, but literally every scene in this 3 hour movie is the coldest shit ever. 
1101 So few things of interest happen in this film that it's entirely a testament to Coppola's precision and immaculate mise en scene this gets even halfway off the ground. And then it goes the full distance. 
1102 G.O.A.T. 
1103 Is The Godfather, umm‚Ä¶ underrated?? Sometimes I read takes zagging on this flat-out masterpiece, but that has to be for the sake of controversy, right? Can anyone really watch this and go ‚Äòmeh‚Äô? I guess to each their own, but to me that‚Äôs an insane position to take. Watching this again on the big screen cemented the fact that¬†‚ÄúI believe in America‚Äù remains the greatest opening line of any movie ever. That‚Äôs just a fact. More thoughts here. 
1104 I knew Santino was going to have to go through all this and Fredo... well, Fredo was... But I, I never wanted this for you. I work my whole life, I don't apologize, to take care of my family. And I refused to be a fool dancing on the strings held by all of those big shots. That's my life, I don't apologize for that. But I always thought that when it was your time, that you would be the one to hold the strings. Senator Corleone, Governor Corleone, something. There wasn't enough time... Michael. There just wasn't enough time. 
1105 Lol me la vi otra vez en menos de 1 semana...me estar√© volviendo loco? üò≥ 
1106  It was beautiful to finally write that title in Docs when starting this review but that was about the only thing I could write until I came up with this excuse of a review. Well, don‚Äôt mean to sound like that because I wanna take the time to remember my grandma who died when I was 10 which was 9 and a half years ago. I wish I got to know her better. My grandpa said she was extremely knowledgeable‚Ä¶  
1107 Another one that I‚Äôm glad I finally got around to...Really good. The 3 hour run time was a smooth ride, the plot is engaging, the twins and turns hit hard, and the characters are killer. My personal fav is Robert Duvall‚Äôs Tom Hagen.Is it just me or have the Letterboxd servers been on the fritz for awhile now? 
1108 The Godfather is, without a doubt, pure brilliance. Not only is the acting from Pacino, Brando, Caan, and Duvall some of the best I've seen, but the elegant direction and flow of the story make this crime drama the true gem many hail it to be. It's thought-provoking, intense, shocking, and beautiful. A true hallmark of the film industry. 
1109  This is the third year in a row, watching The Godfather in hopes of loving it. The first two times I just didn't like it, let alone love it. I feel like the 0.01%. So here I am, hoping the third time is the charm, even though ironically that isn't the case with The Godfather Trilogy since nobody like Part III.First off I want to say I love Brando, but why is his voice so raspy in The Godfather?‚Ä¶  
1110 this might actually be the greatest film i have ever watched. 
1111 Men. 
1112 ‚ÄúA man who doesn‚Äôt spend time with his family can never be a real man‚Äù. 
1113 A genuine masterpiece. A lightning in the bottle picture where every element, every performer, every word truly fires on all cylinders.First time watching the spectacular 4K restoration ‚Äî first viewing over-all for, probably, 10-15 years. 
1114 Fucking flawless 
1115 "Revenge is a dish best served cold, but loyalty is the bond that keeps empires standing." 
1116 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   ‚ÄúEl Padrino" me parece un film notable, pero personalmente encuentro que es la pel√≠cula m√°s sobrevalorada. No porque est√© muy sobrevalorada, sino porque est√° sobrevalorada por muchos.La vi por primera vez, y no encontr√© ninguna escena, ning√∫n pasaje, ning√∫n di√°logo, ninguna actuaci√≥n, ning√∫n plano, ni ning√∫n momento que haya quedado fascinado. Nada. Es toda la pel√≠cula notable, sin errores, muy bien hecha, pero no hay nada que me haya asombrado, sorprendido, extasiado, golpeado o cualquier otro verbo o adjetivo‚Ä¶   
1117 This film has a really cool Zootropolis reference. 
1118  "I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse." Bueno ¬øQue voy a decir yo sobre esta pel√≠cula? Si, es una masterclass de storytelling, de direcci√≥n, de actuaci√≥n y mi aspecto favorito aqu√≠ que fue la fotograf√≠a.Se que la iluminacion es algo muy cuidado en cualquier producci√≥n, pero aqu√≠ en espec√≠fico hay algo que hace que me parezca incre√≠ble, la iluminaci√≥n en esta pel√≠cula crea gran parte de su identidad, especialmente en las escenas de la oficina de Vito‚Ä¶  
1119  My first viewing of the first two¬†Godfather movies were terrible. I wasn‚Äôt in the right mood to watch two very long movies. My mindset while watching them was thinking these are two of the greatest movies ever made according to everyone. So when I got to watching them, I found them to be exactly the opposite of great. I was actually pretty hateful of these movies for a long time, and whenever someone would bring them up in conversation I‚Ä¶  
1120 Blew me away once again, this time on the big screen. "I believe in America" 
1121  This is my 3000th film logged. I figured there was no better time to watch this juggernaut. It was a shameful blind spot, and this year happens to be its 50th anniversary besides.It was amazing to think I could watch this movie now and still be surprised by some of the plot developments. This film is one of the most heavily referenced in our popular culture. even now.I'd expect my opinion of The Godfather will only strengthen with‚Ä¶  
1122 Whenever Marlon Brando spoke I held my breath, quieted my thoughts, listened intently. Partially because he‚Äôs a compelling actor who demands attention when he‚Äôs on screen. Mostly because I couldn‚Äôt understand a word he was saying. 
1123 ÿßŸÑŸÖÿπŸÜŸâ ÿßŸÑÿ≠ŸÇŸäŸÇŸä ŸÑŸÑ Masterpiece. 
1124  I don't really feel like talking about film right now but this was a much better rewatch, although I think there were some things that weren't as good as the first time. I definitely saw a few new flaws and I think the arc isn't as well done as I had been thinking of it as. I also think Brando, although a great performance, doesn't quite live up to the greatness that everyone says it has. But that's all the‚Ä¶  
1125 I mean people ain‚Äôt wrong when they say this is one of the greatest pieces of cinema there is. Everything from the cinematography, the beautiful scores and of course the acting from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. Watching Michael‚Äôs story from patriotic war hero to ruthless new head of the Corleone family is so well done, with the Baptism scene truly being the symbol of Michael‚Äôs rebirth and transformation into the next ‚ÄòGodfather‚Äô. A true staple of the Mafia genre. 
1126  What, exactly, can I say about The Godfather that hasn't already been said thousands of times over? That it's one of the few movies that lives up to its reputation? That Marlon Brando was the GOAT? That Al Pacino gives a great performance? That Francis Ford Coppola proved to be a great director with this? That cinematographer Gordon Willis knew how to use shadows and nighttime to his advantage? I could say all of that, but at this point, it's‚Ä¶

1128 Do you denounce Satan?I do.Watched this in theaters, at my local arthouse, with my parents who‚Äôd never seen it before. Best possible way to watch this. I already loved it, but I realize now that both it and it‚Äôs sequel are even better than I‚Äôd given them credit for. It‚Äôs like a whole other film on rewatch, and especially in theaters. Just magical. 
1129 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Saw it in the theater.The best part is how menacing Michael is by the end despite being 5 foot 6  
1130 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  I watched this with a friend who fell asleep thirty minutes in and woke up for the last thirty minutes. This is his review: ‚ÄúWhen I went to sleep Micheal was a normal guy, but when I woke up he‚Äôs just murdering everyone.‚Äù

1134 FINALLY WATCHED THIS! Obviously a masterclass in film making and an iconic piece of cinema but I‚Äôd be lying if I said this was an easy watch. It‚Äôs super long and I wasn‚Äôt engaged nearly as much as I was hoping. However, by the end it all clicked. It‚Äôs kinda hard not to appreciate this monster of film. 
1135 i put this on without saying anything so that every member of my family could come into the room individually, look at the screen, and sigh in disappointment. no one ever forced me to watch godfather growing up so i'm just trying to make up for lost time what's wrong w that!!shoutout to james caan for being built like an ape. biggest shoulders in new york 
1136 Absolutely slaps. Nothing more to say except the baptism scene might be one of the best sequences of all time, and Michael Corleone is the hottest man to ever live.

1148  What can be said about The Godfather that hasn‚Äôt been said already? It‚Äôs absolutely riveting from start to finish. Coppola‚Äôs direction is top notch, and the cast is one of the best in film history. I‚Äôd heard Marlon Brando was a great actor, but this was the first film of his I've seen the entirety of and this is one of the most deserved Best Actor Oscar wins in movie history. Absolutely masterful performance. Without going into spoilers, I will‚Ä¶  
1149  93A brilliant juxtaposition of familial sympathies and gun-waving, blood soaked grit, FFC‚Äôs three hour initial step into cemented film history is one that lives up to virtually every one of its exhausted accolades. From its Christmastime aesthetic highs to the dimly lit enthralling hospital sequence to the nostalgic film-grainy wides of the beautiful Sicily rural, everything is leavened with a certain amount of craftsmanship and filmic pride, making it abundantly clear that Coppola lacked absolutely nothing in the dedication‚Ä¶  
1150  i‚Äôve been avoiding this since forever, for three reasons: the subject of the film itself is on the unappealing side to me; its gigantic reputation made me afraid of it being unjustified and afraid of not liking it; and the long running time and the fact that are three of them were just too good of an excuse for my laziness.god.god. why did i take so long?it‚Äôs amazing, unbelievable almost. technically it‚Äôs impeccable. the cinematography and soundtrack‚Ä¶  
1151 No movie is perfect. They can never capture reality as it truly is. But The Godfather is the closest thing we have to perfection. 
1152 How much of what we believe to know about the Mafia is based in fact, and how much of it do we owe to this movie? 
1153 is it possible to rate this more than 5 stars? i think im gonna have to talk with the letterboxd admins about that. 5 stars just ain't enough for this PURE CINEMATIC MASTERPIECEprobably the best thing to have ever come out in film history for the last century. bar none. that's right i went there boooiim still in awe 
1154 "I believe in America." 
1155 You haven't truly experienced The Godfather until you see it on the big screen.It's beautiful.With that being said....GET THE FUCK IN MY TOP 10 
1156  there's definitely a reason for the endless praise the godfather gets. well, a lot of reasons. the intimate look at family, the interesting comparisons to a capitalist society, the stunning cinematography and soundtrack, the amazing acting...my personal favorite thing is how it basically serves as a coming of age story for michael, only replace the usual sexual frustration with violence. a lot of violence. very dark stuff. both in tone and in a literal sense. the use of shadows‚Ä¶  
1157 Look Ma I've finally watched The Godfather! 
1158  "I believe in America."I first saw THE GODFATHER at age 13. Despite much of the complexities of the story going over my head, my little brain knew it had seen a film that seemed more "sacred" than normal movies. Much of it was the cinematography, though I didn't know the word at the time. If this had been a book, it would have been a book written on golden pages. Something about the film and its storytelling and visuals‚Ä¶  
1159  Better than people make it out to be, The Godfather deserves a tad more recognition in my humble opinion. Only 99% on Rotten Tomatoes, 2nd highest on IMDB, top average rating on Letteboxd, 4 out of 4 Roger Ebert and Timeout's 2nd best movie of all time behind Toostie‚Ä¶ everybody‚Äôs a critic right? Well time to give some long overdue credit. There's a lot of flavour on offer, the opening scenes are immense and Pacino and Brando are mesmerising. I‚Ä¶  
1160 Dumbed down version of The Brothers Karamazov. 
1161  Such a freaking classic. Don Vito Corleone: You talk about vengeance. Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me?. the godfather to me is a bloody brilliant masterpiece of a film and people may say it is not they cup of tea and am okay with that but this movie changed the way that I thought of movies, the story is about a man called Don Vito Corleone who has this big family‚Ä¶  
1162 I saw it, FINALLY!Great and powerful. Everything else has been said already. 
1163 Everybody talks about this movie constantly as one of the classics, and everybody is right.

1171 "Leave the gun, take the cannoli." No matter how many years have passed this film is the perfect example of a true classic. A true masterpiece! 
1172 blackmailing Sony into funding Sam Raimi‚Äôs¬†Spider-Man 4 by gatekeeping my unique and original opinions on The Godfather 
1173 Now I‚Äôm so glad that every time that I tried to watch The Godfather something got in the way because that means that I ended up watching it for the first time in a movie theater with my best friend ‚ù§Ô∏è.Also lol at me for thinking that The Godfather was some kind of obtuse, metaphorical title when in reality Don Corleone is just a literal godfather. 
1174 Too many Italians 
1175 forced my sister to watch this so she could understand my love for al pacino but she fucking fell asleep 15 minutes in and then left to go to bed right before the sicily scenes needless to say i will not be speaking to her 
1176  The first time I watched THE GODFATHER was when it aired Thanksgiving weekend 2002 on VH-1. Whenever they cut to commercial, they would have a a celebrity quoting their favorite line, and the worst one was Jon Bon Jovi saying "leave the gun. Take the cannoli."* The smug little smile on his pretty plastic face will forever haunt my dreams.That I can still watch this on a semi regular basis without suffering intense psychological flashback trauma is a testament‚Ä¶  
1177 It's The Godfather. There's nothing I can say about it that hasn't been said already. I absolutely loved it and it deserves the hype it gets. 
1178 "It's not personal, Sonny. It's strictly business."I'm not sure what I can say about this movie what isn't already said before.The score, the cast .. what Corpola created is one of the most iconic movies out there. Endlessley scenes to quote and to love. Are there still people out there who didn't watched this yet? Seriously .. go see the reviews and watch it .. 
1179 take the cannoli 
1180 I've always said I don't like The Godfather as much as most people, and not as much as some people think I should, but each time I watch it, it grows on me a little more. Today's re-watch was a refresher to prepare me for the sequels which I've never seen. I liked it more today than I ever have, so maybe I'm finally coming around.Ron's recommendation: Must see. 
1181  I believe in America. America has made my fortune. And I raised my daughter in the American fashion. I gave her freedom but I taught her never to dishonor her family. She found a "boy friend," not an Italian. She went to the movies with him. She stayed out late. I didn't protest. Two months ago he took her for a drive, with another boy friend. They made her drink whiskey and then they tried to take advantage of her.‚Ä¶

Marlon Brando is perfect as Vito Corleone. He steals the show in every scene. Al Pacino is also really good. The whole vibe of this movie is beautiful. It is so different from what I expected.

But it‚Äôs worth it, in the end, as Francis Ford Coppola delivers a masterpiece of a film, which is so well done, it‚Äôs utterly fantastic. I‚Äôve seen my share of 3h movies over the years (Avatar, The Batman, King Kong, etc) but this is one of the finest yet.‚Ä¶

1194  idk it‚Äôs definitely good but after having seen Scorsese‚Äôs Goncharov idk if the godfather is deserving of ‚Äúgreatest mafia movie ever made.‚Äù it is interesting to me how the cultural reexamination of Goncharov is something we never once did with the godfather, which has always been untouchable brilliance in the eyes of all who see it. and yet the movies are so similar- the story and tragedy behind Goncharov and how it got forgotten makes me wonder if the Godfather‚Ä¶

He‚Äôs in three scenes and everything he says and does is an absolute riot. KHARTOUMMMMMM!!!!Say what you want about Sollozzo and his drug business, but I really appreciate that he gives his driver positive feedback after they pull a U-turn on the George Washington Bridge to lose Michael‚Äôs tail. We cannot help but stan that kind of nurturing leadership.

1203 Doesn‚Äôt get better than seeing this on the big screen. A masterpiece that deserves every bit of praise it gets.

1209 I'm probably gonna write a long review at some point explaining why this ,along with part 2, is my favourite film of all time. For now, you already know why this film is great. 
1210  When a family patriarch barely escapes his own life, his own son plants bloody revenge.Well, this was quite the jump from the last movie I've watched. I'll be truthfully honest, not my kind of movie, but apparently, this is the quintessential "Filmbro" movie that I had to check out. One dreary Thursday after online class, I've decided randomly, "Hey, let me go watch The Godfather just to see what the hubbub about."Like Citizen Kane, this film wasn't gonna go‚Ä¶  
1211 Orange ya glad Michael doesn‚Äôt eat fruit? 
1212 I don‚Äôt know how to objectively rate The Godfather¬†anymore. It‚Äôs truly iconic and not in the loose way kids today throw around that word. It‚Äôs universally beloved by all men, young and old. It‚Äôs got so many great one-liners. The music is romantic, yet chilling. I think what I admire most about it is it‚Äôs confidence. 
1213  My introduction to The Godfather came from a guy selling pizza. Tagline: "A pizza you can't refuse."People like me who came of age after The Godfather was published and made into a movie knew these works first by the imitations and parodies they inspired. I saw tons of comedians imitate Brando's performance before I ever actually saw Brando himself. I saw lots of knockoffs and appropriations of Coppola's style long before I saw the movie they were borrowing/stealing from.‚Ä¶

1219  Watched on Blu-Ray Like his colleagues and friends Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, Francis Ford Coppola belongs to a generation of cultural figures whose place in film history is unchallenged and who played a decisive role in shaping the medium of film during the turbulent 1960s and 1970s. In the search for filmmakers who would attract that same new generation of moviegoers to the theatres, the still very young Coppola was given the directing job on the adaptation of Mario‚Ä¶

In fact, there‚Äôs no such thing. However, a few continuity errors and some dated sound design issues don‚Äôt stop Coppola‚Äôs first Best Picture winner from being one of the finest films ever made.

1228 The only issue I had with the film is that the time jumps weren't made very clear. It's spanned over a period of ten years and there were quite a few instances where I found the film hard to follow because it does have these sudden jumps through the years without much effort of making you aware. Otherwise, yes, it was splendid! What is recognised as one of the all-time greats I think is rightfully so. I feel no need to go beyond that. 
1229 Finally watched this masterpiece. 
1230  The Godfather has always been one of those blind spots for me. I have always wanted to watch it but that damn runtime of 2hrs 58mins was intimidating me, and trust me I saw how acclaimed it was. All I can say is, believe the hype, no actually it surpasses it! The Godfather respectfully deserves the spot of the best film ever made! The acting is perfect from its entire cast especially Marlon Brando and Al Pacino; both bringing their‚Ä¶

1232 EVEN BETTER ON A REWATCH!‚ÄúLook how they massacred my boy.‚Äù 
1233  One of the all time classics of cinema, one of the greatest films ever made, and during one of the greatest five film streaks of all time. Imagine doing ‚ÄúThe Rain People‚Äù, then ‚ÄúThe Godfather‚Äù, then ‚ÄúThe Conversation‚Äù, then ‚ÄúThe Godfather Part 2‚Äù, then capping it off with ‚ÄúApocalypse Now‚Äù. It‚Äôs a complete miracle that Francis Ford Coppola was able to finally make a complete masterpiece of cinema and able to instantly go up to legendary status with this film.‚Ä¶  
1234  It‚Äôs still a great film, however I think I have to bump it out of my top 4. The actual contents of the film can be a bit unoriginal. However, Marlon Brando is an absolute legend as The Godfather. Al Pacino was great portraying Michael. The actual base of this film is really interesting because it‚Äôs about the mob which was actually a huge part of America during that time. The horse head scene was actually really entertaining and my‚Ä¶  
1235  A grandly poetic tale ‚Äî its grainy, amber-hued images like faded photographs brought to life in memory, a mythical quality that justifies the air of romanticism and the ridiculously over-the-top toll booth scene.

His fist in his mouth when Santino noticed her sister's face really I felt that

1239  Finally after 6,660 days alive on this planet, I decided to watch this masterpiece that everyone had been talking so much about. Why did I wait so long to watch it, maybe it's because I didn't feel like I was ready yet to watch it but also because it's now my 1000th film I've seen on Letterboxd.Did I like it? Well yes of courseDid I love it? Not reallyI think the film has a lot to offer‚Ä¶  
1240  This is the Godfather of American Classics. Francis Ford Coppola is a master craftsman. I can only imagine what Scorsese must have thought of this when he saw it in theaters. This film was on the precipice of a major shift in American Cinema.The production design in this film is beautiful, with a simplistically dark color palette, like a painting of the old 'American Dream.'¬†It's use of shadow and sprawling-takes help to define the somber tone.¬†The sound design is‚Ä¶

SO WHO'S CULTURED NOW, HUH?!?!That said, The Godfather is beyond great and an astonishing piece of filmmaking. It even improves on its (also great!) source novel.Still weird how Coppola claims that Marvel movies aren't cinema just because he made a masterpiece of a film that is about as long as Avengers: Endgame with a fraction of that movie's budget and... okay, he has a point.

1264 THE GODFATHER is always a welcome re-watch over the holiday season. This 3-hour movie has a blisteringly fast pace and it‚Äôs always over before you know it. Al Pacino (playing Michael Corleone) is fantastic. Going from the son who wants nothing to do with the family business to the fearsome and frightening new leader of the Corleone family looks like a walk in the park for Pacino. A flawless transition for the character. He left me feeling cold.

1266  This is directed by Francis Ford Coppola. His daughter directed the film ‚ÄúLost in translation‚Äù. I just watched that too.

1274 If I don‚Äôt watch this movie for a long enough time I start to think it‚Äôs overrated and doubt it‚Äôs placement in the canon.But, nope, every rewatch it proves it‚Äôs worth, and it completely bowls me over.The romanticism and the violence combine in a way that feels fresh and vital while also being classical and intrinsic. In the end it just feels timeless. Possessing qualities of both memory and anticipation that enraptures the audience.¬†Watched the Restoration Blu-Ray and even the subtitles are handsome as fuck.¬†It also makes me want a pitcher of wine and big-a bowl-a pasta! Mangia! 
1275 Wow, The Godfather is a perfect movie?Weird. Couldn't have guessed. 
1276  It‚Äôs ridiculous that it took me 23 and a half years of living to see this movie. But finally, here we are. I‚Äôve seen the movie.It‚Äôs one of the greatest of all time.Pacino gives such a brilliantly subdued performance, which is really incredible to behold when I‚Äôve only known him as the ‚ÄúGIVE ME ALL YOU GOT‚Äù / ‚ÄúDUNKACCINO‚Äù / ‚ÄúSHE‚ÄôS GOT A GREAT ASS‚Äù guy for so long.

1279 Having not enjoyed this initially, I finally understand why this is regarded by many as the best film of all time after rewatching it. So many iconic quotes throughout along with all-time great dialogue I'd say is only 2nd to Pulp Fiction. The complete contrast as leaders between Brando's honest and moral approach and Pacino's ruthless approach was particularly intriguing. Impatient for part two now as Pacino continues to assume the reigns.

1300 Lex Talionis.Despite its reputation for having the greatest scenes in cinematic history, there's no single moment in The Godfather that won me over. It's simply greater than the sum of its parts. Akin to a fine glass of wine instead of the thrill of a shot.

Well, today is finally the day I conquered The Godfather (and Part II).Absolutely flawless. Coppola's ability to frame shots is astonishing. Every scene is this way.

Und jetzt erst ist mir bewusst geworden, dass der Film sich ohne Action ganz langsam entwickelt, und mich dadurch ganz besonders fasziniert. 
1314  Decided to make my 500th film logged here one of the essential viewings. The big one.I loved every second of it! Everything I could and would say about The Godfather¬†has been voiced an innumerable amount of times, so I‚Äôll keep things brief: it‚Äôs entirely impeccable.I actually made an attempt to view The Godfather a couple years ago, but only made it halfway through because it was late at night and I wanted to be attentive (essentially more awake)‚Ä¶

1317  Probably one of the most important films out there and one that really shows how we've elevated to a level of contemporary filmmaking in today's standards.

1318  Okay confession time: This is my first time watching it and I've put it off for a very dumb reason. A long time ago, when I was probably in my teenage years, I caught the very last couple of minutes of the third film on TV and as a result, it discouraged me from watching the trilogy. Like, what's the point of going through this whole saga if I already know how it ends? So for a long time, these‚Ä¶

1321 don't tell Francis Ford Coppola I watched this for the first time today on the train with sunlight glare hitting my laptop for half the movie. 
1322  So... Since 2022 is coming to a close, I decided I had to watch The Godfather before it was no longer the 50th year anniversary, and today I did. And oh boy, that choice is turning out to be one of the greatest decisions I have ever made. I don't know why I do this, but oftentimes with widely acclaimed films I always find myself grossly underestimating their stature in the film world, then becoming completely floored at their profundity,‚Ä¶

1326 Got to catch this is Dolby for its 50th anniversary release. Great experience in the theater, as would be expected with this film. I have so much appreciation for just how much this film forces you to pay attention to so many characters all at once and expect you to remember their importance. Masterpiece.100% 
1327 i wasn't paying attention so boring god bless üôè 
1328 I watched this movie for the first time with my dad and I don't think he sat down the entire runtime for more than a minute because he would stand right next to the TV and point out every little detail there was. (I think that might have confused my 10-year-old self even more) Anyways I've seen this 4 times now (3 of the times actually being old enough to appreciate it) and I still love every second. One of the most rewatchable movies in my opinion. 
1329 absolutely nuts that coppola‚Äôs the godfather is a world-renowned masterpiece, yet it‚Äôs not even his best work. 
1330 Tha Gahwdfathah. I have not watched this movie. What I will say is that after my fourteen year old brother saw it, he talked in this awful New York accent for, I shit you not, three weeks. Insufferable. I would rather die than watch this movie, mostly because I'm afraid the same thing would happen to me. Hence the low star review. 
1331  Haven't seen this in ages but i figured i should rewatch it before i watch Part 2 which i'll probably see tomorrow, i remember this was (probably) the first big classic movie that i ever saw so it left a big impact on me, almost saw this on Pacino's birthday which would have been cool but eh any day where i get to watch this movie is a good one.I mean what else can i say?

None of these things turned out to be true, and I'm very delighted by this. A film being called the best movie of all-time definitely will be called overrated by most, but this film is just excellent in every aspect. Its story is as masterful and interesting as‚Ä¶

1338 The scene where Luca Brasi pays his respects to the Don at the wedding sends chills down my spine. I read that Lenny Montana was very nervous about acting with Brando, so it works on both levels. The respect is genuine. 
1339  This is the first time I've watched The Godfather since high school; I'm sure at the time, I likely appreciated the film for its historic importance, but on this snow day, I appreciate it for so much more. Coppola's growth as a filmmaker from his first four films is tremendous‚Äîthis is so much more textured, so much more thematically and emotionally complicated, and it feels like the confident expression of a soon-to-be master. I imagine that this is one of‚Ä¶

1370 listen you guys don't understand michael isn't actually a bad person u just don't know him like i do he's a really sweet little man he was just in a silly goofy mood 
1371 It really was strictly business.5/5 3rd viewing 
1372 So yeah I'm not going to spend a lot of time telling you to watch The Godfather. It's the film you've already heard from your dad and every other guy is the greatest film ever made. So yeah, it's the greatest film ever made.Absolutely recommendP.S. Asked my partner if she wanted to watch this with me which she quickly responded with a definite no. Later that week asked if she wanted to watch Face/Off and she excitedly said yes. I think she's the one. 
1373  I don't like violence, Tom. I'm a businessman; blood is a big expense. Caught this on AMC this afternoon and put it on in the background. Didn't get much work done and spent most of the time saying "oh my god this fucking scene." Good day. 
1374 What's to be said that hasn't been said a million times before, it's the Godfather. Definitely a film I would consider to be arguably one of the the best I've ever seen.The baptism scene is BY FAR the best scene in any film ever in my opinion aswell. 
1375  Film 31 of my 100 movies watched in 1 month challengeMy past few reviews have been relatively negative and I wondered if I was just in a bad mood. Turns out I was honest how I felt about those because here‚Äôs a movie that I did enjoy and have no problem saying so. This movie was a bit long sitting at about 3 hours but it‚Äôs hardly boring. Watching the Corleone family do their mob thing is interesting and‚Ä¶  
1376  Es gibt tats√§chlich einige Gr√ºnde warum ich die Reihe nicht allzu sehr mag und zum Schluss auch einige warum ich sie mag. Es sind drei Dreistundenfilme die zur H√§lfte aus Familienfeier, Gottesdienst, Hochzeit, Kommunion, Taufe und "Gesch√§ftsmeeting" bestehen. Ich dachte immer man m√ºsse christlicher BWL-Maxi sein, um das wirklich genie√üen zu k√∂nnen. Vor allem, weil Coppolas Reihe all das mit konservativ-reproduzierenden Bildern bis zum Abwinken in aller Ausf√ºhrlichkeit abbildet, aber in Abgrenzung zu seinen Zeitgenossen auf jede formale und inhaltliche‚Ä¶  
1377  For years, I've put off watching the Godfather trilogy. Some of it is due to the long run-time; a near 3-hour movie is always going to be at the bottom of the pack when I'm deciding what to watch, especially a hard-hitting gangster epic. Not exactly the easy watch that lets me switch off my brain after a day of work. Reputation is also a big factor in my cinematic procrastination. I often feel overwhelmed by acclaimed masterpieces, perhaps afraid‚Ä¶  
1378 In case it wasn‚Äôt already obvious, this movie is flawless. 
1379  Watching this now, for the third time I didn't get bored once. I understood every scene and I was so immersed by it compared to how I felt last time. It‚Äôs a film still being reviewed, analysed and talked about, there's nothing really I can add. You all know it's great. You all know the cast, editing and the script were brilliant. You all know it's one of the best gangster films of all time. I loved the dynamic of‚Ä¶  
1380 WOOOAHHH . Finally finished it ...This was great , one of the finest piece of cinema ever . The preformces from everyone are amazing and the music oooh that music . There's not much to say about it that wasn't been said other than its a masterpiece . Cant wait for the second and third one v excited .9.8/10 
1381  I've been trying to write a review for The Godfather, which I just saw for the first time today, all day. Even during our Thanksgiving get-together, this film was in the back of my mind (btw a great Thanksgiving movie). But it was only at our get-together that the personal aspect of this masterpiece hit me. I'm not that close with my family. I don't talk much with them, and I frankly am not the most comfortable around them. So‚Ä¶  
1382 genuinely angry that i missed out on this film for over 18 years... it was a masterpiece 
1383 Much better on re-watch.Even though I don‚Äôt technically ‚Äúenjoy‚Äù this, I have to recognize and appreciate how absolutely perfect¬†this film is. It may not be my favorite but it is 100% the best Italian mob family film ever made.The Don‚Äôs death scene is pure, say it with me...poetic cinema.10/10 
1384  finally got around to watching this masterpiece!!¬†i don‚Äôt feel the need to go into detail, as everything that could‚Äôve possibly been said about this film has already been said. i‚Äôll just say i absolutely loved this. truly one of the most iconic and well recognised films ever and for good reason. i was scared that i‚Äôd get bored but i wasn‚Äôt at all and i was really doing this film a disservice by not seeing it before but i‚Äôm so‚Ä¶  
1385 la escena del bautismo... chills literally chills. todo el desarrollo de michael corleone es incre√≠ble,a al pacino le qued√≥ perfecto ese papel porque pudo captar totalmente lo que es el deseo de poder, el querer ascender para ser alguien. ya quiero ver la segunda, que me dijeron que est√° todav√≠a mejor. 
1386 I did not care for this movie. It insists upon it self. 
1387 Not to sound like a filmbro but this will forever be a freakin‚Äô masterpiece thank you mr. coppola and mr. puzo for gracing us with your vision and making a 3 hour long epic look fantastic and stimulating all throughout the duration of it(also yes i know it‚Äôs been a week since i‚Äôve been to this app but i was not in the right state to watch films due to me procrastinating a lot of homework from my online classes lol but i‚Äôm back!) 
1388 What‚Äôs the point of writing a review of this movie? There‚Äôs nothing new to add. It‚Äôs just amazing. 
1389 The Godfather+Remastered in 4k for silver screenings+Amazing live orchestration+Sittin' in the 2nd row while watchin' and feelin' it so goddamn rough=Without any doubt one of finest experiences in film I've ever witnessed in my entire life ‚ù§

1395  I share my love for The Godfather with, I imagine, almost everyone on this site. The fact that it runs for close on three hours yet consistently grips the audience's excitement is a testament to the huge talent involved in realising the vision of Francis Ford Coppola.It is a masterwork in characterisation, creating a galaxy of personages richly drawn, memorable and just plain fascinating.

1396 Just noticed that this is also directed by Tommy Wiseau...Bravo Letterboxd. 
1397 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  This time I watched The Godfather for my film scores class, and as a result paid much closer attention to the music throughout, and it's genius. There's a motif that represents Don Corleone throughout the film, and a separate one that tends to represent Michael, BUT THEN in the last scene when the members of the family enter Michael's office and call him Don Corleone, THE DON THEME PLAYS. Chills, for real.Gee wiz Sofia Coppola's dad sure can make some good pictures!(also lmao at current me for rewatching this before even seeing part ii, smh @ myself)

1401  My 500th log on letterboxd.¬†I have finally reached 500 logs on letterboxd and this was the perfect selection for it. The godfather lived up to the hype for sure. Michael Corleone is one of the best characters I have ever seen period. Pacino was the perfect casting and he put on a damn good performance. Brando has Vito wow I knew he was really good in this but holy shit that performance was incredible. Probably a top 10 performance‚Ä¶  
1402  It's hard for me to reconcile the differences between this and the novel it's based on. Not because the book is particularly good (it reads more like an airport book than it ought to), but because my favourite parts of the source material are almost entirely absent from this film.Specifically, my favourite/most interesting character in the book, Johnny Fontaine, who essentially acts as the only thorough perspective that isn't related to Vito by blood or marriage, is entirely absent‚Ä¶

1409 Some films can be more personal to me due to the resonance they secure but I don't think there is a more perfect film than The Godfather. It was not necessarily a dream to watch it on the big screen until I did because those were 175 minutes of unceasing ecstasy. 
1410  I can‚Äôt put into words what it is about this movie but it all just works.The entire family feels real and the interactions and dynamics between each member are amazing.Pacino is only operating at 50% Pacino, but I don‚Äôt mind it at all. He‚Äôs still amazing.Beautiful, emotional, and about family.Suck on that, Vin Diesel.Also, during the Look How They Massacred My Boy scene, I‚Äôm sorry to say I was holding back laughter because I remembered‚Ä¶

1414 A glorious epic, with characters so real and relatable, despite having lives that are so different to my own. Michael Corleone's character arc is probably one of the greatest in film history. Cannot wait to rewatch Part II and finally brave up and watch Part III. 
1415 at one point, i accidentally pressed some random button on the remote and skipped to the end credits and really thought hmmm... what an interesting and sudden ending but no actually that was entirely my fault 
1416 100 MOVIES IN ONE SUMMER - FILM #33Let me just start this off by saying this:Did I love it? Yes.Is it one of the best movies ever made? Not really.Is it overhyped? Kinda.This is a fantastic and ambitious film, but I don‚Äôt really see why it‚Äôs held in such a high regard. It didn‚Äôt really need to be 3 hours, either. If it were paced better, it could‚Äôve worked as a 2 1/2 hour film.I‚Äôll still watch Part II because I heard that it was better. 
1417  It was interesting to go back and see this after 15 or so years. It's a very good movie and I do enjoy Francis Ford Coppola's direction, however I am not the biggest fan of mobster movies. The movie plays a little different for me as I have grown and someo of the motivations sit a little differently. The image that stuck with me the most on this viewing was the closing door at the end that reminded me of‚Ä¶

1419  Well, it is a common knowledge that The Godfather is one of the most beautiful movies in the history of cinema so i‚Äôm not adding much new by saying that.Anyway, I‚Äôd like to share my opinion about it.Every single aspect is worth of a mention. The casting? Phenomenal. Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone and Al Pacino as Michael Corleone were probably two of the best choices in history of cinema. The acting is really terrific: Brando‚Äôs is‚Ä¶  
1420  Wait, that was three hours? Huh?! Most economic three hours I've ever seen.Pop culture osmosis means I've "seen" the opening act, ie the wedding to the horse scene.

Of all the movies to remain spoiler free it's only one of the most well‚Ä¶  
1421  Sooo ‚Ä¶ I finally watched the Godfather. And it was different than I expected it to be, yet exactly what I hoped it would be. But, as every possible thing has been said about this, let me explain what my personal experience with The Godfather was like.First off, even though The Godfather has to be one of the most quoted and referenced movie of all time, I knew nothing about the story. Italian mafia and family matters were the‚Ä¶

Very few films have ever done that. Everything was perfect, from the acting to the ending, the wedding scene to the murders. Every single character was written to the length I question whether it‚Äôs possible for this movie to be real.üé≠THE ACTING:the acting was‚Ä¶  
1423  So much has been written about The Godfather and most of it is true. There‚Äôs no atmosphere quite like it, as Francis Ford Coppola builds an aspirational ensemble around a wedding, and you want to be included. The film is a warm invite to a big family function and the viewer feels included too, both in the glowing warmth of the big family and in the darkened back rooms where the cost of what the crime family has built takes‚Ä¶  
1424 When Sollozzo and the ‚Äúcrooked cop‚Äù are taking Mike to Louie‚Äôs but take the Jersey fake-erooo, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to Jersey‚Ä¶,‚Äù there is no music but now the tires on the bridge start their droning red shift for the moment Michael thinks the plan is coming apart. Lovely point of view.Then into Louie‚Äôs where the trains roar and there is no score. What do words matter when fate is set? The words meaningless? Out of the bathroom is Mike, and the subtitles for Sollozzo‚Äôs bargaining Sicilian disappear in his final moments. Unbelievable scene. 
1425 Little late to the party but i finally got around to see godfather for the very first time and now i can finally understand why people loved this movie so much why it is so hyped. I absolutely love this movie I had a great time watching it. it is already in one of the best movies that i have ever seen acting,writing,cinematography all was absolute 10/10 al pacino and Marlon brando performance was the highlight for me. So excited to watch the next part now. 
1426 theres not a single role al pacino cannot play i fear!!! 
1427 watched this to calm me down during a bad panic attack. it worked. 
1428 After a long while I‚Äôve finally got around to starting this infamous trilogy. I have so much to say, but what I could even think of has been said for decades now. Such an incredible film from start to finish I was hooked in, the defining feature of this film for me was Michael‚Äôs character arc throughout and how you see him progress into the don of the this crime family. Incredible and I cannot wait to continue my watch of the trilogy 
1429 It's deranged how long it took me to watch this! This film which so many people call "the best of all time" and even though I do not consider it my number 1, I still see this as one of the greatest films I have ever seen in general! This film had so much influence in the crime/mafia genre and still influences it today."The Godfather is a true masterpiece!"

There‚Äôs nothing I can say that will do it justice, from Brando‚Äôs subtle mannerisms, to Pacino‚Äôs brooding glare, the tragic deaths, the rise of Michael Corleone, the symbolic and religious finale that ties every piece together. Cinematic perfection, and a brilliant way to cap off a birthday.

1443 i mean i only watched this movie because im tired of people asking me "have you seen the godfather?????" 
1444 Bizarrement, j'oublie toujours √† quel point The Godfather est parfait. C'est clich√© de d√©crire combien c'est un chef-d'oeuvre, mais c'en est un sur toute la ligne et le Blu-ray 4K lui rend totalement justice. üê¥

1448 Undoubtedly one of the greatest cinematic achievements. 
1449 That score in the cinema was something else, sent chills down my spine at certain points. 
1450 There‚Äôs really no other way to say it,¬†The Godfather¬†is a perfect film. I‚Äôve never seen such a complete story, told from start to finish, that has done so like this. I was so lucky to have been able to see it on the big screen, in a Dolby Cinema theater, for its 50th anniversary. 
1451 So glad that I had the chance to watch this masterpiece in the cinemas/theatres. 
1452  The age of people freaking out when I tell them I haven‚Äôt seen The Godfather has finally come to an end. Well, good things come to those who wait. My reward for waiting all these years was getting to see the gorgeous 4K restoration in Dolby on the big screen. A certified cinematic masterpiece through and through, The Godfather is a three hour epic that justifies every minute of its runtime.¬†I‚Äôm not really sure on the climate of cinema‚Ä¶  
1453  Rewatching after Sopranos, The Godfather is much more enjoyable.Michael's ArcThe Godfather is all about Vito Corleone's plunge and his youngest son, Michael's Ascension. He is a decorated war hero who fought in the world war II, he is strictly on the legal side of the business until his father is shot. He is shown to be smart and a Stoic personality opposite to Sonny, who is more emotional and dumb when it comes to decision making. Michael alienates‚Ä¶  
1454 I haven't been in cinema since December, namely since watching Spider-Man: No Way Home. and now to see The Godfather on big screen is a real event. the second time it looks better, more consciously. I watched some scenes with goosebumps. It was a great experience 
1455 should've rewatched paddington tbh 
1456 The classic that everyone says it is, perfect story, perfect acting, perfect finish. A perfect film.There isn't much point in saying anything else, it's all already been said many times before, I mean it's the feckin godfather!! watch it!!

1459 RIP michael corleone you would‚Äôve loved kendall roy 
1460 Such an essential film in movie history. Lots of respect. 
1461 "I can't remember the last time you invited me to your house for a cup of coffee. Even though my wife is godmother to your only child. But let's be frank here. You never wanted my friendship. And you were afraid to be in my debt. (...)You never needed a friend like me. But now you come to me and say, "Don Corleone, give me justice." But you don't ask with respect. You don't offer friendship. You don't even think to call me godfather ". Iconic. 
1462 This for me was that film that sits on your shelf for years because the hype for it is so damn overwhelming that you can't help but fear that it just won't live up to your expectations. Luckily I could have waited 20 years to watch this and it still would have been worth the wait. 
1463 It‚Äôs all true. Every word of praise you‚Äôve heard. Every accolade bestowed at the feet of the all mighty Godfather is worth more than the gold it‚Äôs made with. I keep thinking Im going to grow tired of Coppola‚Äôs magnum opus. Here‚Äôs the thing though. Instead I keep falling more and more in love with cinema every time I watch it.

1470  Rewatching the trilogy and actually giving my thoughts this time.The problem is there isn‚Äôt much to say that hasn‚Äôt already been said. It‚Äôs one of the best movies ever made, nearly flawless in every aspect.

There are countless iconic and amazing scenes, but¬†I firmly believe that the‚Ä¶  
1471 happy birthday to my dad who‚Äôd probably kick me out of the house if i rated this lower than four stars :) 
1472 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   That scene with the diner bathroom has got to be one of the finest constructed ever put to film. The tension generated both leading up to and within the scene itself, aided greatly by the knowledge of Michael‚Äôs established place within the family and the adept development of his arc up to that point, is not simply drawn from the stakes inherent within the situation, but from the question of whether or not he will really go through with it.‚Ä¶   
1473 So torn between my desire to live inside The Godfather and my desire to not be brutally murdered.¬†Guess you can‚Äôt always have your cannoli and eat it üòû 
1474 93I‚Äôm actually surprised on how much I got from the first watch. It certainly was an ‚Äòepic‚Äô. Also unlike Goodfellas and The Irishman, I genuinely enjoyed this one. I‚Äôm not a fan of mafia ‚Äòstuff‚Äô at all, but this one was an exception.Seeing Vito as a grandfather really got to me too as it brought me back to my childhood with my grandfather. 
1475 ‚ÄúA friend should always underestimate your virtues and an enemy overestimate your faults.‚ÄùImmaculate. Can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve been so wrong about this film all this time, but it goes to show how much difference a year, or rather in this case, two years, makes. It‚Äôs deeply magisterial the amount of mastery, intricacy and passion Coppola pours into this work, and in such divinely, cinematically majestic ways that really highlight his ardour and¬†legendary status as a filmmaker and icon of the American New Wave.The Godfather is truly one of the greatest films ever made, and it certainly lives up to that title. 
1476 underrated movie, no one ever talks about it 
1477 this was purely a 70s al pacino thirst watch 
1478 Just checking, it‚Äôs still perfect 
1479 Considered one of the greatest films ever made and for good reason, Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather is the textbook definition of a masterpiece, with Coppola and author Mario Puzo crafting a gripping mafia and family story that's deeply powerful and beautifully complex all the same, not to mention full of magnificent performances, nerve-wracking tension, phenomenal dialogue, gorgeous cinematography, and memorable characters. 
1480  "I believe in America." Some thoughts:- A universal story about crime and family that is as epic in scope as it is thematically rich. - Every character, while all performed to perfection by the actors, feels unique and relatable. - Absolutely groundbreaking on a technical level. While Coppola didn't necessarily invent certain formal techniques, he without a doubt used them more purposefully and cleverly than any filmmaker at that time. - Quite possibly the greatest character arc of all‚Ä¶  
1481 for years and years i thought that the godfather was holding a chicken on the poster. i never questioned that. i even drew this once in a game of pictionary and emphasized the chicken feet holding the marionette strings. so imagine my surprise when i watch this and it's not a chicken, but the world's most lovable cat. i even turned off the subtitles to see him better. i'm sorry i thought you were a chicken, bud 
1482  Alright, I‚Äôm sure everyone is pissed at the Oscars for some reason or another so perhaps I‚Äôm safe to post this so it goes under the radar that I lowered this by a full star...I‚Äôm not gonna go into detail, but everything about the movie is excellent, I just kinda feel like it‚Äôs kneecapped by a strange lack of focus? It trims the fat of the novel it‚Äôs based on but also hops around from character to character based‚Ä¶  
1483  Never leave the cannoli behind...Francis Ford Coppola's iconic gangster epic forever changed not only its own genre but cinema as a whole. The Corleone family as well as all of their allies and enemies were given three dimensional personality through timeless performances. One of the major pieces in the New Hollywood movement, this was an artistic dive into the vicious organized crime underworld that even had the biggest book snobs admitting that film adaptations can exceed their source material.¬†‚Ä¶  
1484 After 28 long years, I finally pulled the trigger on Coppola‚Äôs masterpiece and settled in to watch it the way it was meant to be seen: in bed, with wireless headphones, trying not to wake my sleeping girlfriend. 
1485 lol yeah I liked this a bit more than I did when I was 13.It's crazy how much someone's tastes can change over a decade. How the fuck did I not love this movie before? 
1486 As an Italian intellectual would say, bellissimo!!! 
1487 Goodness, I don‚Äôt think this one is ever going to age! It‚Äôs definitely a special movie. 
1488  The Godfather is often labeled as the greatest film of all time and boy does it live up to that name. The Godfather is a landmark in motion picture history and is a cinematic masterpiece. There is nothing weak about this film, everything about it is powerful.The script is sound and the film is full of complex characters. Marlon Brando (Don Vito Carleone) is the perfect leader of the family and a very intimidating figure, Al Pacino (Michael Corleone)‚Ä¶  
1489 Simply put, The Godfather seriously challenges the assumption that no film can be truly perfect.

1501  I felt like a nice, safe rewatch tonight so I decided that this would be a good one which in retrospect is kinda funny because this is a 3 hour slow burn film that is honestly one of the most devastating films out there but I still consider it a comfort film for many reasons. I‚Äôve seen this so many times that I‚Äôve memorised the dialogue for the majority of it so whenever I revisit it I don‚Äôt get a‚Ä¶  
1502 It‚Äôs like‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs not as good as Morbius (2022) but it was alright. 
1503 My dad & I started rewatching this film this past Christmas, and after pausing halfway because I was getting tired we finally resumed the rest today. I couldn‚Äôt tell you the last time I saw this film, but finally coming back to it all these years later‚Ä¶it‚Äôs honestly pretty much perfect. Coppola really is just that guy.Grade: 4.5/5 (A) üòÅ

1505 average film enjoyer opinion (but I still haven‚Äôt watched the other ones) 
1506  I think this movie is good but people overhype this movie so much.For me this was just good, for example I would rather watch Robert de Niros Casino before I watch this again, this movie is just pretty average in my eyes and I'm still looking to see what people find so amazing about this movie as there isn't really anything I can think off the top of my head.Another thing about this movie I disliked was the‚Ä¶  
1507  Me:¬†I don‚Äôt know what to do, Godfather. It‚Äôs been a long week for me, long week. Anyway, if only I could watch a movie with masterclass acting, a perfectly well written thematic story that still manages to be relatable no matter how violent or gritty the crime can be, an esteemed director at his peak pioneering his craft into one of the most influential films of all-time, it would put me back on top. Oh, Godfather, I don‚Äôt know what‚Ä¶  
1508  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna make him an offer he can‚Äôt refuse.‚ÄùI put off watching this film for so long, mainly because I was worried that it wouldn‚Äôt live up to its name of being ‚Äòone of the greatest films ever made‚Äô. Also, while I tend to like most of the films that I watch from it, mafia/crime isn‚Äôt normally my go-to genre. This film‚Äôs lengthy runtime was quite daunting at first, and I didn‚Äôt want to start watching something from a‚Ä¶  
1509 The Mike Trout of movies - just hit after hit after hit after hit. Also, still perfect. 
1510 Pretty good I guess 
1511 Trust me, I know what you‚Äôre thinking. ‚ÄúHow hasn‚Äôt Kallen seen The Godfather yet?‚ÄùI know.¬† 
1512  The 4K Blu-Ray just dropped on Tuesday, so yes, this is happening.I believe in America. - BonaseraThat's the first line in this movie, and it's beautiful because it's a lie. I'd argue it's the most important line in all three of the Godfather flicks, because that's the whole theme of the saga, right there in the first scene: there is the myth of America that people can try to believe in, and then there is the real America,‚Ä¶  
1513 I'll be doing a full review of this on my channel in the coming days, but let me just say right here, "Holy Shit...What Masterpiece." That is all for now.

Ich kann es immer noch garnicht glauben. ¬†Das Bild war super, der Sound war gut und nat√ºrlich hatte ich Pl√§tze in der Lounge.Auch wenn zwischendurch mal einer geplappert oder den Sitz verstellt hat, war ich noch nie in einem so ruhigen Kino. In allen entscheidenen Momenten war das Kino so ruhig, dass man schon fast vergessen hat, dass man den Film mit anderen‚Ä¶  
1515 I mean, I feel like everyone in the world has written an essay on this movie, so instead I‚Äôll offer this: both Robert Duvall and James Caan played Will Ferrel‚Äôs dad in other movies. Thoughts? 
1516 Did i watch the wrong movie? Because if i could give this 0 stars i would 
1517 This movie sucks because there aren't any dinosaurs in it. 
1518 i absolutely did not watch this but wanted to announce my astonishment at 500 followers you absolute MORONS my entire existence is a joke but i love you all so much xoxoxo¬†i have some time off so i might fuck around and watch some classics or i might finally fulfill my goal of watching the ice age saga in chronological order (i‚Äôve never seen any!) or maybe both.¬†the world is my oyster!!! 
1519  Since we're all gonna die, there's one more secret I feel I have to share with you: I did not care for The Godfather.What?Did not care for The Godfather.How can you even say that, dad?Didn't like it.Peter, it's so good! It's like the perfect movie!This is what everyone always said. Whenever they say...Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, I mean, you never see, Robert Duvall!Fine. Fine. Fine actor, did not like the movie.‚Ä¶  
1520  imdb top 250 ranked¬†I cant believe that there are people walking on this earth who think this movie sucks and is overrated.¬†I always put watching The Godfather off because of the length and frankly, I‚Äôm not a big fan of mafia type movies.

1521  being 20 years old means that i‚Äôve been hearing about this movie almost every day for the past 20 years without watching it. i‚Äôve always thought of it as this grand, larger than life gangster flick and although it is very much that, i did find a very personal story etched in there as well. the weight of family and the honor of sacrifice clashes with romance, love and violence. seeing michael rise up the ranks and finally become the‚Ä¶  
1522  Very few filmmakers are able to construct a mood the way Coppola does in The Godfather. The use of dark oaky colors throughout establishes the world of the Corleone family as one of concealment and secrecy while the melancholy soundtrack coats the film in a layer introspective sadness and regret. At times it can almost feel as if the score is calling out "things would have been better had you listened to the Godfather". Lighting is used to great effect,‚Ä¶

1524  I‚Äôm really glad I liked this, I was afraid this was gonna be one of those situations where it really was just really over hyped, like I just experienced with in to the spider-verse. Well I do think this was a little over hyped I really liked it. Marlon Brando is insane in this. He‚Äôs real good. James Caan is really good in this to and he was probably my favorite after Brando.I think my favorite thing about this‚Ä¶

1526  Film 6/20 of Movies by Decade: 1970s List of reviews: here-----A film that should need no introduction, The Godfather certainly lived up to the hype for me, as I was totally enraptured into this three hour mafioso crime story. I was admittedly a little nervous going into it as I've had some bad experiences with films that have been so universally acclaimed or hyped, and I'm not a fan of Marlon Brando but thankfully I was blown away‚Ä¶  
1527  It seems that the first question everyone asks about "THE GODFATHER" is concerned with Marlon Brando's interpretation of the title role. That is the way the movie has been programmed and promoted: Brando, Brando, Brando, and more Brando. The word from advance hush-hush screenings was wow all caps and exclamation point. More exclamation, in fact, than explanation. More than one whisperer intimated that Brando's make-up (by Dick Smith, the auteur also of Dustin Hoffman's Shangri-La face-furrows in "Little Big Man")‚Ä¶  
1528  "It's not personal Sonny...it's strictly business."- Michael CorleoneIn 1972 Francis Ford Coppola released what is now regarded as one of, if not, the greatest film(s) of all time. That film is The Godfather. The film is based upon Mario Puzo's novel of the same name. In my opinion the film is superior to the book. The book is great no doubt, but it has a lot of unnecessary backstory for some of the minor characters (such as Johnny Fontaine)‚Ä¶  
1529 I really do think this is a masterpiece.The acting, story, character development are sooo good.A negative thing is that i lost track of all the names. They all look like each other, at least with the clothes.And that took me out of the movie at times.I know that this problem will be solved when i will Watch at again.¬†This is the movie i have seen most review and recaps on because there is so much going on.Its an beautifull movie with some great shots and amazing Music and i love this, tho i aint gonna Watch it often 
1530 Masterpiece! 
1531  ‚ú®üé¨Unseen Classicsüé¨‚ú®I'll make him an offer he can't refuse. Yes, your eyes are not deceiving you. For I, a movie nerd, am only just now seeing The Godfather for the first time ever in my life at 30 years old. It's even more blasphemy that I still somehow (in my own way) have fond memories of this film been spoken of with high regard because it was one of my dad's favourite movies. He'd used to always do the‚Ä¶

1533  It insists upon itself.I'm sure many can relate‚Äîthis is the film your dad always had on in the background, probably on the AMC network or something. You saw at least 20% of it over the years, all out of context. You remember the baptism scene, oranges, horses, certain assassinations, and especially the ending shot.It's great to finally watch this. Perfect example of a three-hour film done right; the run-time goes by smoothly. There's obviously so many fantastic performances‚ÄîI‚Ä¶  
1534  Masterpiece. A colossal gangster epic. Francis Ford Coppola's crowning achievement in cinema.I could go on and on about the film's fantastic direction, the technical brilliance, the incredible writing and character development of Michael Corleone, the outstanding performances, and the beautiful score. This is the film that made me madly in love with cinema. This is the film that I've resonated the most and had the deepest connection with.

1536  I did it! I finally watched The Godfather!There‚Äôs not much I can say about this film that hasn‚Äôt already been said. There‚Äôs hardly anything else like it. The story of the Corleone criminal enterprise is engaging, chilling and thought provoking. None of the characters are redeemable from a moral standpoint, but you can‚Äôt help but like them anyway. I think Sonny might be my favourite. Of course, many of the greatest scenes involve Vito Corleone, the leader of the‚Ä¶

1538 "Don't tell me that you're innocent. Because it insults my intelligence and it makes me very angry."Even after countless of rewatches, the Godfather is still as amazing as it ever was. It's just so unlike any other film I've ever seen. It plays so incredibly authentic that it doesn't even feel like a movie at all. I really can't give it any better praise than that.250 Favorites 
1539 Way too long but still an iconic masterpiece.

1541 The sick heart - but who can really know how wicked it is?¬†Although the intervening three-hours illustrate, but not always elucidate, the malice, deceit, hypocrisy, envy and slander; you could listen to the opening line and watch the final shot to summate the micro and the macro of the room - its personnel - the door, and which side of it you‚Äôre on. 
1542 The Godfather Part 1 is arguably one of the most celebrated crime movies of all time. You can see the amount of influence its hard on the genre and the set the precedent on what you can achieve. One of the best told stories about the 2 main mob families in Corleone family and tattaglia family. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando were the 2 highlights for me. One paved the way for the other and the other has been blazing the tone of what it means to be an actor of his generation.

1547  90Una perfecta introducci√≥n a el mundo mafioso y la transici√≥n a las nuevas generaciones.Al Pacino deslumbrante aunque no tanto como Marlon hay que decir.Creo que me interesa m√°s ver la familia Corleone liderada por Michael que por Vito, y esto es algo que la pel√≠cula hace muy bien, en dividir el protagonismo e ir pavimentando el camino para el ascenso de Michael con un correspondiente desarrollo adecuado de su personaje a lo largo de el filme.Y‚Ä¶  
1548 Last night we did ~Godfather night~. Started with antipasto and focaccia, then tortellini in bone broth, fettuccini bolognese, and wrapped it up with amaro and cannoli. Trying to convince everyone to do a Scream Night in which we only eat popcorn and red-colored corn syrup.

1551 Too many men 
1552 I can not express the love I have for this film.5/5 
1553  A proper review and not a snide dismissal of a movie I‚Äôve seen at least twenty times:A fun and charming piece of pulp that would‚Äôve been smushed into a ninety minute potboiler in the time period it‚Äôs set in, but in the New Hollywood era was allowed to be given the epic treatment that it deserved. You can see so many different eras of filmmaking run through this film, the legendary mannered performance of Brando and the searing visceral‚Ä¶  
1554 Watching The Godfather in 4K UHD is absolutely stunning. Seeing it in my home theater on a large screen in this format, the way it‚Äôs intended to be seen, just reaffirms its already colossal status. Its actors, its production history, its notorious and iconic scenes are now legendary, but at 50 years old it‚Äôs still just as classic as it ever was. Just a great story, well told. Watched via Paramount Pictures 4K UHD Blu-ray.  
1555 al pacino es el hombre sexo 
1556 Brando is simply iconic as Vito CorleoneWatching this in a theater was a special experience 
1557 A film about opportunity. The good things that come from it and also the consequences. America is a country made from blood, sweat and tears. The corleone family from the outset understood what needed to be done for them to thrive. It's rare for a film to be perfect but The Godfather is one of those. It's an epic with the type of scope that's missed these days while also moving at a brisk and controlled pace. 3 hours has never felt more like a clean 90 minutes in your life. That ending will forever give me chills. 
1558 Just came back from watching this in cinemas(rewatch). Its a masterpiece,idk if i ever had it easier to give a movie 5 stars,the phenomenal perfomances in this movie are unbelievable. The restaurant scene is one of my favorite scenes oat and i cant describe how good the christening scene was. definitely one of the best movies of all time and i just cant understand the ppl who give this movie less than 5 stars.10/10Peak cinema 
1559 Seeing Don Corleone pet a cat on the big screen had me in absolute heaven!!! üñ§üòªAlso, what an experience seeing this for its 50th anniversary in theaters?? Truly a wonderful experience 
1560 Muhammad Ali is the GOAT. Michael Jordan is the GOAT. Tom Brady is the GOAT. "The Godfather" is the GOAT. 
1561  Being able to see this at the cinema for its 50th anniversary after 4 years of not watching it is one of the best experiences I'll probably ever have. Yes, it deserves every single bit of praise and there isn't jack shit that can be said. Its literally perfect, flawless, there isn't a single problem in it. It might just even be the best film ever made, and I wouldn't even question someone giving it that title. Every single scene‚Ä¶  
1562 The GOAT in Cinema! Every scene is perfection. So glad I got to finally see in cinemas. 
1563 this is/should be one of everyone‚Äôs inevitable 5 star films.Update :well call Me a hypocrite‚Ä¶ 
1564  Yeah so I got to see this in the theater and I‚Äôll leave you with a few words.13 year old me was a dumbass. I shoulda been sucking on a pacifier rather than watching classic cinema. The whole thing went over my head while I was goo-goo ga-gaing. I‚Äôd like to go back and give myself a punch in the jaw. Going around running my mouth ‚ÄúGodfather is overrated. GoodFellas is better! Blah blah blah.‚Äù (GoodFellas and One Upon‚Ä¶  
1565 A purely operatic crime drama told on an almost Shakespearean level. A subtle tragedy in its darkened and murderous macrocosm, but a colossal triumph for American cinema. This is quite possibly as good as it gets. 
1566 this is like succession if they were a little less mentally ill 
1567 happy 50th anniversary to the greatest movie ever made <3 
1568 Leave the gun, take the cannolis. End of tweet. 
1569 Michael gets punched in the face and is visibly bruised¬†- then he kills two people, moves to Sicily, meets a girl, marries the girl, and becomes a widower before his black eye has fully healed.¬†Must have been one hell of a punch.

1573 every time i watch the restaurant scene i feel like my heart is going to explode from beating so fast 
1574 Need to watch again before I can fully express my thoughts, but for the time being, let me just say that I looooove this film. Final Verdict: A+ 
1575 If only Italians were real üòî

1579 This one continues to get better every time I watch it. There are so many tiny details I keep picking up on with each viewing.An undisputed masterpiece. 
1580  Fuck. It's perfect in every way. The first time I saw this I was only 14, I really liked it but maybe didn't fully appreciate it. I had it on my overrated movies list, not because I thought it was bad but becauseI felt everyone praised it way too much.

Otherwise, fun!Small side note, the characters in this suck and are bad people, but it‚Äôs so satisfying to watch Vito and Michael be so smart and competent at what they do. I couldn‚Äôt help but think about I Care A Lot and how a lot of people felt the main character was too mean and ‚Äúgot what was coming‚Äù because she was very competent at doing bad things.

1589 I don't trust anyone who rates this film lower than a 9/10 just because of others that came out decades later like Goodfellas. Even an 8/10 I'll barely accept. Any lower though and I think you're trying to troll everyone or piss off those film students. Speaking of trolls, I would love to see Hollywood make a film about the asshole producers of this. It's guaranteed to be great. 
1590 okay filmbros‚Ñ¢yes it‚Äôs still phenomenal¬†yes i was still anxious during the restaurant scene lmaoyes the cat stole the show in the opening scene¬†apollonia ü•∫üíïfuck hollywood for sexualizing the actress to the point where she didn‚Äôt want to act anymore 
1591 u know what Don Corleone imma start giving my boys kisses on the cheek too 
1592 Watching all best picture winners in random order.¬†I don‚Äôt know if this or Part 2 is better but this is still one of the greatest movies ever made. Not much needs to be said at this point. 
1593 This is one of the two craziest films I‚Äôd never seen before (the other being Jaws). Yeah, it was great. I think it intimidated me for a long time because of the runtime and also because with gangster/crime movies, I often find them hard to follow and at times I did here but it was so worth it. Marlon Brando‚Äôs performance is the standout but character wise, my favourite was Michael. Such an excellent journey that was an great vehicle to tour the ins and outs of the mob in the 40s/50s.

1596  *insert your favorite line from The Godfather because I can‚Äôt choose my favorite since there are way too many*The Godfather is a staple in American cinema. It‚Äôs an iconic classic. I remember watching this in 2015 and loving it from the get go. While Chaplin‚Äôs The Kid opened the door for me to explore the art of Cinema, this film kicked me over the threshold. It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve seen this film and the effect it had‚Ä¶  
1597 me, sweating & befuddled trying to come up with literally anything original to say about this movie: uhh...umm...the establishment shots of la when going to woltz‚Äôs studio clearly influenced bobby z with who framed roger rab-[self combusts] 
1598  How do you write about The Godfather without saying what‚Äôs already been said a million times? What do you say about the film that may not have started the movement that changed American cinema, but became the embodiment and ultimately the most influential film out of all of them? The film that is considered one of the best films of all time‚Ä¶and deserves it to this day?As I said, it‚Äôs hard to not go repeating everyone else. So I‚Ä¶  
1599 This is the 100th film my mate Joel and I have watched together since both starting to use the diary system a few years back. I'd watched it years ago, but we'd been biding our time to wait for the right opportunity to pop his cherry, and this was his moment. Spoilers: It's still a masterpiece. I don't even know if Part 2 can compete with the meticulousness of this bad boy. It's just flawless in every way. 
1600 A captivating crime thriller, with excellent performances (Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are the standouts) and stupendous filmmaking.I won't lie, it does feel sluggish at times, but otherwise, The Godfather is filled with numerous emotions and morality. 
1601 So finally I made up my mind to watch this trilogy after immense procrastination. The second highest rated film of all time. 
1602 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna make him an offer he can‚Äôt refuse.‚ÄùThe Godfather is a 1972 crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola who co-wrote the screenplay with Mario Puzo, based on Puzo's best-selling 1969 novel of the same name. ¬†The story, spanning from 1945 to 1955, chronicles the Corleone family under patriarch Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), focusing on the transformation of one of his sons, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), from reluctant family outsider to ruthless mafia boss.This was my first‚Ä¶   
1603  76The quintessential film bro movie, however you want to interpret that. For me at least, after years and years of it being hyped up as one of the greatest films of all time...wow, was this an outstanding disappointment. To be fair of course, with the reputation that The Godfather has pretty much anything would have been a disappointment, and in that regard I should say that I still like this film a lot. But it is...exactly what I think‚Ä¶  
1604 ITALIAN AMERICANS LETS MAKE SOME NOISE 
1605 Who knows how many times I've watched this. Still iconic, still masterful. One interesting thing from this watch, I noted just how little screentime John Cazale gets as Fredo in the first film - I don't think he's on screen for more than 5 minutes. 
1606  Holy shit they were right. The Godfather is an extremely entertaining film about family, about power, and about being the biggest badass in the room. Don Vito Corleone is the coolest man in cinema, and he never lifts a finger. Marlon Brando is just as perfect as everybody says he is. You really know that he loves his family, and there are some great scenes of them all just hanging out and loving each other. Plus, Grandpa Vito was the‚Ä¶  
1607 yeah 1972 bruised face al pacino could deffo get it+ this movie never gets old it‚Äôs so SO good i‚Äôll never ever shut up about it¬†i swear ON THE SOULS OF MY GRANDCHILDREN (hope u see what i did there) 
1608 we love you al pacino 
1609  Film Nr. 1000: The Godfather. Genau, es hat 999 Filme gebraucht, damit ich mir endlich dieses vielgepriesene Meisterwerk zu Gem√ºte gef√ºhrt habe. Ohne Frage DER grosse Meilenstein der Filmgeschichte und tausendfach von hochrespektierten, in die Tasten h√§mmernden Berufskritikern Szene f√ºr Szene umgekrempelt und bis ins letzte Detail analysiert. Daher m√∂chte ich mich gar nicht weit aus dem Fenster lehnen und meinen Amateursenf dar√ºber giessen.Der Film √ºberzeugt so ziemlich auf allen Ebenen. Mit seinen 175 Minuten Laufl√§nge hat er dann‚Ä¶  
1610 I‚Äôm only rating it bc if I don‚Äôt it‚Äôll fuck with my stats page, but honestly I had such a bad headache and I zoned out 12 times and only could really focus for the first and last half hour at most, but those were all pretty good. A lot of shit happened to characters I didn‚Äôt know the names of but y‚Äôknow it‚Äôs all part of the fun.I really only watched it so I can say I‚Äôve seen The Godfather and... well I‚Äôve seen The Godfather. 
1611 I belong to an ethnic Italian family and I'm seeing this movie for the first time in 2020. Probably the best character arc ever written, honestly. That's all I have to say. "Leave the gun, take the cannoli."One of a kind 
1612 Perfect. It's absolutely perfect. 
1613 It‚Äôs a great film and very before it‚Äôs time but my god my attention span can not take a 3 hour movie. 
1614 Hollywood storytelling at its best. Just a perfect piece of cinematic construction with a smooth as butter narrative, fantastic characters brought to life by an impeccable cast, and some really awesome dialogue. Hard not to love. 
1615 After reading the Mario Puzo novel a couple of years ago, I think I appreciate this film even more than I did watching all those years before. The book is so pulpy and has a number of chapters centered around Sonny‚Äôs mistress that make no sense at all. Coppola took that book and made a masterpiece. This is a film that will never age, never deteriorate, a film that will only get better time after time. It‚Äôs the fucking Catalina wine mixer of gangster films. 
1616 Spectacular film, got you on the edge of your seat with interest and curiosity. Sophisticated characters filled with untold history, interlaced moral situations that make you think twice about messing with someone's family. Don Corleone, trust me at the top it isn't lonelyyy. 
1617 the baptism scene is one of the best moments in movie history!!!! 
1618 i don't really have anything to add, other than i just saw nipples on cable thanks to michael's old country wedding night and it was probably the least offensive thing in the entire movie lol 
1619 kay: michael i love you¬†michael: do yall hear sumn...? 
1620  Master's Movie Challenge:A film that I'm ashamed I haven't seen yetHoly shit.After experiencing one of the most famous movies ever made today, I was in a state of shock. I couldn't believe what I had witnessed. For some odd reason, I always thought of The Godfather as a 'film school' movie where the plot isn't that important. I couldn't have been more incorrect. The plot is what drives the 3-hour run time. The plot is so engaging‚Ä¶  
1621 Al Pacino... homeboys gonna like... get it 
1622 Hey did 'yall know that Sofia Coppola's dad made movies? Wild! Anyway this is good but it feels like two different movies that are kinda just stitched together. Also Marlon is a bitch who can't act I'm glad he didn't have much screentime which also brings me to him winning the Lead Actor Oscar. He's definitely supporting, Al Pacino is the lead (and he's a very good lead). The cinematography is great and there are some really cool shots (tHAT LAsT sHoT!!) so that was nice. Also miss Diane Keaton really is that bitch where is her supporting actress nom, huh? HUH??? 
1623 SANTINO "SONNY" CORLEONE DESERVED SO MUCH BETTER. 
1624 You could say that it is overrated, but you would be wrong. The Godfather is the greatest movie ever made.  
1625 I will not indulge anyone with any sarcastic comments or try to be witty, I will just be straightforward with you:The Godftaher is fucking incredible, and if you don't like this film, you better have a good fucking reason for it.100/100 
1626 "'Godfather' is a term used by his friends, one of affection, one of respect." - Michael Corleone, The Godfather Part II 
1627  The Godfather is one of those films that I normally keep for a special occasion. It is such a legendary movie that even a simple review requires respect and appreciation of the genre defining movie.Where do you start? Francis Ford Coppola was 32 years old when Robert Evans hired him to direct "The Godfather". Giving Coppola the reins to such a revered book was a big surprise. His previous films were flops and once he was on board he set‚Ä¶  
1628  The Godfather seems to get even better every time I see it.Marlon Brando is Vito Corleone, the mafia don whose empire starts to crumble when he opts out of a move into narcotics, only for war-hero son Michael (Al Pacino) to enter the fold, jettisoning his father's dream that he'd become a senator. It's grand and sweeping, and yet intensely personal: a wonderfully-acted fusion of family saga and human tragedy whose key players inhabit a vivid world of fierce‚Ä¶

1634  Finally got myself into watching the Godfather after i heard ‚ÄúOh my god u didnt watch Godfather??!‚Äù like at least 50 times my whole life.It was good because i liked the comedy aspect out of it the most, I only took the movie serious when the movie wanted me to do it. 90% of the movie is just sicilians talking funny and it was peak for me.Would I consider it one of the best movies ever made?

1636 Not as good as Black Swan (2010) 
1637 Wow I didn't expect this to be as good as it was. From the first half of the film, I was blown away from how good it was. Michael's character was amazing, his development was some of the best development I've probably ever seen in a movie he was fantastic. I need more Al pacino after watching that. The sequences were shocking at times, my jaw was on the floor during the restaurant scene. The build up, the suspense, tension during parts of the film were done brilliantly. Every character had a purpose and served so well to the story.This was incredible

1641 I finally did it, folks. After putting it off for so long, I finally saw what many consider the greatest film of all time. Now people won't yell at me, criticize me, or make fun of me for not watching it (though they'll probably do all three cause I waited so long to watch it, but what do I know?).I still don't understand what Peter Griffin meant by "it insists upon itself" though.

1647 they put crack in al pacino as michael corleone 
1648 this movie does nothing but appeal to the male fantasy. all women are whores, all men are superior mafia bosses. couldn‚Äôt finish the movie, i‚Äôm still convinced it only exists so that male film students can shame women for not liking it lmao

1651 I honestly can't believe I didn't watch this earlier. Unbelievably good. 
1652  I never want to see this ever again!! God damn. Yes, it's very well made, but I just don't care!! My film studies teacher is obsessed with this film so I don't really want to have my opinion be drowned out by everyone in the class. I gave this four stars last time, but this time I was paying a lot more attention and the whole time I was just ugghhhh.I will say the baptism scene was gave this‚Ä¶

A story of immigrants, capitalism, power, succession, and how corruption takes root in the heart of a man. With of course the best score of all time no questions, and probably the best ending‚Ä¶

1670  On the bonus disc of the Corleone Legacy Edition blu-ray set, there is a feature titled The Godfather on the Red Carpet-HD. I assumed it would be cool old footage of the premiere from 1972.

1675 al pacino as michael corleone is literally the only 1.5m man i am genuinely afraid of 
1676  It was very good to revisit this film, because now knowing the story, I had an easier time understanding the events. And that was one of the reasons that got in the way of my other experience, I didn't understand the reason for certain actions and I missed a lot. It is necessary to pay attention to the lines and names of the characters (which are many, another reason why I got lost), each action has a consequence and now‚Ä¶  
1677 Finally got round to watching this ‚Äì the quintessential 'I can't believe you haven't seen' film ‚Äì and the family member I was watching it with came out to me a few minutes into the runtime, so we barely watched it because we couldn't stop talking to each other with joy and candour and shared experience. I guess I still haven't really 'seen' it, just had it as a slightly discordant three-hour soundtrack, but I'm logging the memory <3 
1678 What a picture. Paramount 4K looks incredible. 
1679 I did it, I finally watched it!! WOWWW 
1680 Est ce que al pacino se rend compte de la chance qu'il a d'√™tre al pacino 
1681  Talking about the Godfather can only go two ways, you either write a lengthy review talking about how good it is or you write a few lines, ackeknowledging how everything's has already been said about it and how good of a movie it is. I guess this is the latter, but I hope one day I can attempt on delivering the former. The Godfather's scope is immesureable, tremendous, its naturalism, its plot-heavy yet visually engaging tale always lit in gold‚Ä¶  
1682  Top 250 - #11--Yeah, it's the Godfather. Yeah, every aspect of this thing is wonderfully crafted. Yeah, it's one of the best films ever made (and not even my favourite of the trilogy, Coppola really went off during the 70's huh?) This isn't a violent or hectic gangster film like GoodFellas, it's more about how this organised crime syndicate is built and sustained through generations, and how its structure lies within these families, what reasons they have‚Ä¶

1686 slept through the first hour but seeing those last 30-35 mins on the big screen was truly something else. 
1687 Had to see The Godfather in theaters to fully appreciate this masterpiece as I find it's too comfy of a viewing at home. New restoration is incredible, older masters couldn't do the high contrast and crushing darks justice. Might go and watch this again if it plays into next week. 
1688 All-time classic. 
1689  Hey so there‚Äôs this lesser known film Coppola made before his big break out movie, Jack. It‚Äôs actually pretty good.In all seriousness this was a stone cold masterpiece and I have no idea why it took me this long to watch it. So it seemed fitting to watch it as my 1000th film (or at least 1000th logged, there‚Äôs probably a few I don‚Äôt remember) and I‚Äôm so glad I finally did.

Every film nerd has watched The Godfather¬†and probably the making of documentaries on the dvd or Blu-ray, leaving very little to add to the conversation. Even saying it‚Äôs one of the undisputed greatest films in American cinema is underselling it to the uninitiated and down playing it to those intimately familiar with every frame and quote. Even pithy, short reviews reveal its monumental achievement, so here‚Äôs mine:¬†The Godfather?¬†More like GOODfather. 
1695 anything for 70s al pacino 
1696 I have a simple policy: I see a kitty, I give 5 stars. 
1697 If any film deserves to be called a masterpiece, it's this one. Literally everything about this film is perfect: the performances, the story, the pacing, the cinematography, the shot composition, the dialogue, the score, the costumes, the camera work, etc. It probably has the best character arc in cinematic history. I never get tired of rewatching this iconic masterpiece.

1701 best movie ever made seriously got chills multiple times watching this i want this movie in powder form so i can snort it like coke 12 times a day 
1702 Fredo, you‚Äôre my older brother and I love you. But don‚Äôt ever take sides with anyone against the family again. Ever.¬†Since it‚Äôs the Oscars today, it felt fitting to revisit a couple of my favourite best picture winners. Happy birthday to Al Pacino who portrayed & delivered one of the greatest characters and performances ever, the one and only Michael Corleone.¬†Fun fact: Al Pacino boycotted the Academy Awards ceremony, angry that he was nominated for the Best Actor in a Supporting Role Oscar, noting that his character had more screentime than his co-star, Best Actor winner Marlon Brando. 
1703 michael corleone if you see this i‚Äôm free friday night are you free friday night so we can hang out on friday night if you‚Äôre free I‚Äôd like to hang out on friday night, let me know if you‚Äôre free friday night when i am free 
1704 every single watch of this is just ridiculous, 4th/5th time now and it feels fresh as ever. arguably the greatest rise/fall of any film character i‚Äôve seen, whether you see it as a rise or fall just depends on the kind of person you are.¬†and that folks, is cinema. ¬† ¬†-coppola ranked¬† 
1705  I‚Äôm always surprised by how immersive this movie is. I start it thinking I‚Äôll have something else to do but I end up watching the whole thing and now it‚Äôs nearly midnight and I‚Äôve done none of the work I planned to do for the night. That‚Äôs cinema!I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the story or even the characters, but the lines are well written and delivered with a lot of zest, the shots are perfectly staged, and the‚Ä¶  
1706 this was very good and all, and it‚Äôs very deserving of all the praise - but peter griffin is VALID 
1707 they‚Äôre beyond fucked up for making michael look like that in Italy.... the little bruise his little hat his little vest I will seriously bite my arm off 
1708 It took me 23 years to finally watch the greatest American film every made!!!! ¬†Not much more to say, I love gangster films and this is literally The Godfather of them all!! 
1709  Isso n√£o √© uma cr√≠tica. Irei apenas citar minha ideia sobre o filme mas o que quero deixar abaixo √© uma carta aberta √† The Godfather.¬†-Barzini vai agir primeiro contra voc√™. Vai marcar uma reuni√£o com voc√™ e algu√©m de sua inteira confian√ßa. Como garantia para si seguran√ßa. Nessa reuni√£o, voc√™ ser√° assassinado. Nunca gostei tanto de beber vinho. Estou bebendo mais.¬†-Faz bem para o senhor, papa.-N√£o sei. Est√° feliz com sua mulher e seus filhos ?¬†‚Ä¶  
1710  You talk about vengeance. Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me?I'm happy that the first gangster movie I ever watched continues to be the only one I can enjoy. After coming away dissapointed in films like Scarface and the myriad of Scorseses, The Godfather remains an undisputed masterpiece and personal favourite. First of all, the pacing is phenomenal. I'm shocked that it's a 3 hour long film, because I honestly never‚Ä¶  
1711 Look, everyone! It‚Äôs a perfect movie!¬†It had been a while since I last saw this one, and the older I get and more I understand film, the more I adore this movie. I think its indictments about America and the lies we tell ourselves about our country are dead-on. I had also forgotten that this movie, in addition to being thoughtful and perfectly crafted, is damn entertaining. Even the Sicilia stuff, which used to feel out of place to me, now works wonders and I kind of love it. 
1712 Todas la veces me maravillo con la perfecci√≥n de la simbolog√≠a del bautismo, el contraste con el Michael del casamiento del comienzo y el final sublime. 
1713  Okay, I'm ashamed that cinema has dominated my life for nearly a decade now and at 22 years old, I'm just now watching The Godfather, but as one of my friends pointed out while discussing the film with me yesterday - better than seeing The Godfather when you're just getting into film, is hearing about how great it is for 20 years and how ashamed you should be for not watching it, and then finally seeing it in your 20s‚Ä¶  
1714 maybe i should join the mafia 
1715 i want michael corleone to make me an offer i can‚Äôt refuse 
1716 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  I‚Äôve never wanted to be a part of a family as much as the Corleones.¬†This was a masterpiece.The events were very fast in a very slow movie it‚Äôs confusing a bit.¬†Also a lot of scenes SHOKED the hell out of me, I did not see that coming.‚ÄúI'll make him an offer he can't refuse.‚ÄùI didn‚Äôt feel the length of time in this movie, I enjoyed it, as I say again, a masterpiece.¬†I really wished sonny killed his sister‚Äôs husband. He was a piece of trash.Anyway, all hail the new godfather, Michael.¬†üíö  
1717  This is my favorite movie of all time because I learn something new about life and myself every time I watch it. It has countless lessons and the one I took this time is: a man that doesn‚Äôt spend time with his family can never be a real man.Also it‚Äôs just insanely watchable and entertaining. Like Parasite, it is a perfect mix of high film and entertaining movie. I saw it with my mom in a theatre and I‚Äôll‚Ä¶  
1718 Dedicating this predictable yet well-deserved 5 1/2 stars to the cat in the opening sequence. Little buddy had no idea they were making history by batting at Marlon Brando‚Äôs hands and utterly charming me to the point of needing to watch the same scene 6 times in order to concentrate on what was actually being said. 
1719  Por mais que Walter Benjamin j√° tenha falado da perda da aura da obra de arte na era de sua reprodutibilidade t√©cnica, a experi√™ncia de assistir a uma c√≥pia restaurada de O Poderoso Chef√£o (‚ÄúThe Godfather‚Äù, EUA, 1972, dir.: Francis Ford Coppola), no cinema, mant√©m algo do maravilhoso de se ver uma obra prima em toda a for√ßa presente de sua materialidade.

1720 ‚ÄúFredo, you're my older brother, and I love you. But don't ever take sides with anyone against the Family again. Ever.‚ÄùThis is my favorite movie. Plain and simple. About to watch The Godfather Part II for the first time so that might change but I mean come on, it‚Äôs The Godfather. 
1721 With the oscar winning performance from Marlon Brando, assured direction from Francis Ford Coppola and beautifully crafted storytelling, The Godfather cemented itself as one of cinema's greatest offers. A truly remarkable piece of art. 
1722 al pacino sir i love you 
1723 Just mind blowing. It‚Äôs called the best film of all time for a reason.¬†Marlon Brando was a gift that will never matched. His performances were so unique and so perfect he was just a beautiful talent.¬†Everything else will just be repeats of what you have already heard so I won‚Äôt tread tirelessly treaded ground.¬†But in short, a must see and the greatest film of all time. 
1724  Well... Now I know how it feels to be a virgin on Prom Night getting fucking railed in the backseat of Chads convertible with some cannolis sitting on the dashboard. My cherry has been popped. I have been deflowered. I've been fucked in every way and hole imaginable. I feel like I ripped out of my mothers birth canal holding a revolver and a glass of red wine. My dead Italian/Sicilian ancestors are looking down on me tonight crying and‚Ä¶  
1725 An uncontested masterpiece. 
1726 I'm CRYING. I really don't care what anyone says: The Godfather is in my opinion the finest film ever made. And seeing it in theatres? GORGEOUS. I was totally sucked into the movie (of course because the story is wonderful) BUT also on the big screen we could see the textures of everything and the visual quality of it was so breathtaking I nearly cried. Anyway, I love this movie and I legit teared up at the end, that's how much I love this film. ALSO CAN WE TALK ABOUT THAT MF SOUNDTRACK??? CHILLS. I GET CHILLS. 
1727 10 fake punches out of 10 
1728 I honestly don't feel qualified to make any commentary about this film. 
1729 Finally decided to check this off my list of shame. It's easy to see why it's held in such high regard and often named as the greatest film of all time. Astounding in many ways from the enigmatic performances to the spot on direction and script. Not much to say about The Godfather that hasn't already been said a million times, it's damn good and if you were like me and haven't checked this out, do so right now! 
1730  When I was nineteen or so, I was going through my first year of university and was completely mortified about my lack of cinema knowledge. Growing up in a family that liked to stick to the old stapples, I didn't get to see much of the really seminal pieces of work. When The Godfather came up in discussion I hung my head in shame. I found a copy in my local video shop, when they were still a thing, and‚Ä¶  
1731 For a movie that is 2 hours and 50 minutes, the more I watch "The Godfather", the less it feels like that to me. Probably the magic of phenomenal filmmaking. I can buy that. 
1732 I would give this movie an infinity to infinity score. What a movie a total masterpiece a classic and an legendary film in whole world. Marlon Brando, Al pacino and other cast members were just amazing. i have seen this movie like 10 times and still this movie surprises me and takes my breath away. Don't know why it is 9.2 on Imdb it should 10/10.Greatest movie ever. Hats off to Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo. 
1733 A estas alturas, me parece rid√≠culo hacer una rese√±a de El Padrino.At this stage, writing a review of The Godfather seems ridiculous to me. 
1734 I don‚Äôt think Michael actually believes in God because he was killing people when he said it. 
1735 After a rewacth this was better then my first watch ¬†,Now,¬†Is the godfather 2 better ?For me now this is better then goodfellas that was my second fav oat but now it‚Äôs going down¬†The godfather top 3 movie oat¬†Perfect¬† 
1736 how do i convey my thoughts and emotions towards sonny corleone in a dignified and non-slutty manner

We know ‚Äî this is one of the best films ever made ‚Äî and I don‚Äôt need to tell you that, everyone probably already has said that. But I guess I‚Äôll say it. ‚ÄòThe Godfather‚Äô brilliantly crafted a portrait of family in turmoil that is slowly shown as time goes on across‚Ä¶

1743 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   "So that was the best movie ever," I thought as the credits rolled. I didn't cry, I didn't laugh, I wasn't scared or had a similar, yes, almost physical experience like in 2001. I didn't feel the big emotions like in The Green Mile, or laugh as warmly as in Licorice Pizza. I didn't see the really big pictures like in War and Peace. Not the acting performance of Heath Ledger, who constantly punches you in the pit of your‚Ä¶

1745  I was very excited when I heard that this film was playing at my local theater. Normally, faith-based films are unfairly denigrated by biased secular critics, but this film about God was so extraordinarily good that it even won over the godless haters, securing a 97% Fresh rating on the anti-Christian Rotten Tomatoes. I bought my tickets for opening weekend, pleasantly surprised to find that it was playing in the fancy Dolby theater when I'm used to watching films only‚Ä¶  
1746 I didn't watch it again, I just wanted to elaborate on my previous review. This movie is absolutely a masterpiece that deserves all the praise it gets. Al Pacino is amazing in this. Marlon Brando is great. It's wonderfully written and would love to read the book. It has a great score. I do have one complaint, though, and it's that I thought the ending was a little dragged and just overall not that great of ending.But obviously I love this movie and it'll easily make top 20 favorites. 
1747  saw this at some point in highschool, going into it i knew people considered it the best movie of all time so i had a chip on my shoulder, was probably on my phone and thought it was boring. when youre a kid you want to disagree with the status quo, challenge everything that comes your way. but at 24, this was arguably one of the best movies ive ever seen. my favorite moment was the restaurant scene when he‚Ä¶  
1748 always quite odd when a film is just as good as you expect it to be, no more no less.¬†Quite a shaggy picture in spots, broader than expected, and a janky temporal flow.¬†8.3/10 
1749 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  I wasn't concentrating much in the second half of the film because of the discussion of my pick for Film Cult, Paterson (2016), which I got to host so thank you so much Logan and the rest of the club for being nice and especially to Aneth for not killing me! Thanks for that. That was amazing! As for The Godfather (1972) it was great, however slow-paced it was enjoyable; although I didn't understand some of it, it was still quite interesting. I really need to revisit this!  
1750  I thought it would be a funny bit to go through film school and watch everything except The Godfather so if someone mentioned the "mai wife!" scene from Borat I could go, ‚Äúyes, I know that scene!‚Äù but if someone mentioned the horse head scene from The Godfather I could go, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I don‚Äôt get that reference.‚Äù Just for the bit, of course. And it‚Äôs a funny bit. But sadly, I realized I was doing more harm to myself‚Ä¶  
1751 couldve just stared at a blank piece of paper for the same effect 
1752  I made it 28 years before I felt the need to watch this film, and it‚Äôs sequels, for the first time.¬†When I first go to this films Letterboxd page I was greeted to that unanimously tall bar for 5*. I knew what I was getting into.¬†I was very engrossed in the first half of this or so, up until Michael had to skip town.¬†I tried to love the story, the cast is great, effects are good for‚Ä¶  
1753 Back in the Seventies, my friend John and I cut off the head of a giant bluefin tuna we'd caught earlier in the day, and put it in bed with this asshat named Ray who'd been harshing our mellow. We positioned the tuna's mouth so it was about a half-inch from Ray's lips, then retired to the living room, smoked a couple of bowls, and waited for Ray to wake up.That's how much of an inspiration this movie is to me. 
1754  FILM #11 OF THE DECEMBER CHALLENGEThe Godfather should NOT be considered a classic. It's is extremely overrated. Does that mean it's a bad movie? No, it's actually quite decent. But there are a few problems with the movie that kept me from loving it as much as everyone else seems to. My biggest problem with the film is that the first 2 hours are extremely bland and boring. Very few interesting things happen within those first 2 hours, with‚Ä¶

1758 9.6/10Actually, I have wanted to watch this film for a very long time, but I waited for the right time, and now I have watched it. It's no wonder why this film is so popular and many people praise it, because this film is very good and I like it. There are lots of characters shown and they can be utilized well in the storyline presented. Needless to say, everyone knows how great this movie is!! 
1759 Revered as one of the most iconic and masterful movies of all time, and it completely lives up to it. The screenplay is perfection, the performances are incredible, and the score is probably the best element of them all.What can I say? It‚Äôs the fucking Godfather. 
1760 It's no Godthumb, but I still liked it. 
1761 As far as classic cinema goes,¬†Coppola undoubtedly knows¬†how to craft a story so compelling. It‚Äôs hard to find a film that better exemplifies the art of storytelling than The Godfather.

1767  I mean, what hasn‚Äôt been said about how perfectly made this crime epic is. It is quintessential for how to engage the audience and tell a fully complete story that builds upon multiple characters with such efficiency. What I love about this film the most is actually Nino Rota‚Äôs iconic score, and the production design of this film. Both elements sink the audience into this period piece, and elevates tons of memorable scenes.Brando, Pacino, Duvall, Castellano, and Caan? Perfect.‚Ä¶

1777  its a nasty world filled with violence and betrayal for this dynasty, the inevitable is everlasting. with any role taken in the Corleone family, there are massive shoes to fill, even if that means doing everything in the name of vengeance.its been said for ages that The Godfather is one of the greatest films of all time. i can confidently say that theres no doubting that. ive put this film off for a while due to its apparent runtime.‚Ä¶

1779  Meine Top 250Platz 82Der Pate z√§hlt zu Recht zu den besten Filmen aller Zeiten. Mit so viel Liebe f√ºrs Detail und einem Ensemble das zum niederknieen ist, wurde Mario Puzos Vorlage hier durch Francis Ford Coppola inszeniert. Schon die Er√∂ffnungssequenz ist derart gut gespielt, dass sie den Zuschauer sofort in ihren Bann zieht. Was Brando hier macht, gelingt nur wenigen Schauspielern in ihrem ganzen Leben. Er spielt nicht, er ist der Pate. Und diese Qualit√§t l√§sst den Funken‚Ä¶  
1780 i really have zero idea why i put this off for so long and made myself think i hate movies like this when i LOVED the irishman lmao. but i decided to give it a try finally since my sister owns the dvds and wow i absolutely loved it and the 3 hours flew by honestly. i added an extra .5 stars just for al pacino ü´∂üèªü´∂üèª i‚Äôm gunna watch the 2nd and 3rd one sometime this week too. also i have goodfellas on my watchlist for either this week or next! if u guys have any other recommendations for movies like this lemme know!! 
1781 Perfect in every way. Most movies have that one part that is the 'good' part, but this one has like 20 parts like that. 
1782 Fuck this was good. It‚Äôs taken me way too long cuz a long run time is like running a marathon and I can‚Äôt be arsed, even though if I just clicked on the film I‚Äôd have no problem it‚Äôs just the mental block. I can‚Äôt wait to watch part 2 now though.For some reason the Italian bits didn‚Äôt have subtitles so I hope that was intentional and I‚Äôm not missing dialogue.

1785 This movie is indeed everything everyone has ever said it was. In fact, it is a lot better than that. There are no words that can accurately describe the beauty of this art piece, and also of young Al Pacino.

Se uma d√©cada depois Leone usaria da tem√°tica de mafiosos‚Ä¶  
1787 Not much I can say that hasn‚Äôt already been said. This is one of the true masterpieces in cinema. Literally a perfect film in every aspect from start to finish. It‚Äôs quite long but it ends with an absolute bang. You‚Äôre drawn in right from the get-go and the performances are one-of-a-kind.

1788  "We don't discuss business at the table."Well, this is a slowly burn epic movie! As the 70s movie I think this is very impressive. About mafia family who get in the 'dark' business, competition around them, and revenge.

1790  Grand, sweeping and majestic. It begins with a wedding that is so full of life and energy that we, as the audience, feel like we're guests ourselves, albeit guests who overhear crucial conversations, and get a first glimpse behind the curtains of a powerful family. It ends with a baptism during which a string of assassinations is executed, orchestrated by the literal and figurative new Godfather. Between those two scenes, The Godfather weaves a web of characters and power dynamics‚Ä¶  
1791 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  In the Baptism scene, the moment the baby started crying in the background before all the murders of the head of five families took place was one of the most powerful and chilling build up I've ever seen

1799  50th-anniversary cinematic re-release!The Godfather captures the intrinsic link between gangsterism, capitalism, and patriarchy. What little "action" there is, is presented as horrific and unglamorous: men get beaten and shot unceremoniously on dingy curbsides, their butchered bodies left lying on the cold, New York City asphalt. Meanwhile, the people orchestrating these murders are disaffected business owners, who navigate through endless meetings through strict rules of polite behavior. In their private lives, they constructed a men's world, where the family nucleus‚Ä¶  
1800 American Cinema‚Äôs monument. Profound Shakespearean tragedy framed against a portrait¬†of power in The United States. Ideas such as murder and revenge are presented alongside family and culture. Rather than tired stereotypes, the American criminal is portrayed as an actual human being. Coppola composes his rich tapestry by utilising a cast that has been unsurpassed still. The studio not wanting either Brando or Pacino was quite the revelation. Thankfully, Coppola understood the material and elevated it even further beyond anyone‚Äôs expectations. Films like The Godfather demonstrate the true power of the cinematic medium. I‚Äôm so glad to have seen this on a cinema screen. 
1801 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   This was amazing to watch in theaters, especially in Dolby.I have seen The Godfather before, but on this watch, I could still feel the intensity and anticipation. I could feel my heart beating during the restaurant scene with Michael. It felt as if I was actually in the movie.This is without a doubt, one of the greatest films ever made, but why? Is it because of the amazing performances, specifically by Pacino and Brando? Is it the outstanding‚Ä¶   
1802 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  We watched it in theatres! I know it's a 50 year old movie, but we knew nothing about it so it felt like watching a new film in theatres. I was mostly surprised by how tense and unpredictable this film was, because that horse head scene, the baptism, that exploding car... just to name a few. So genius. Also, I don't know if I'm the only one, but I always thought it was a chicken instead of a cat on the movie poster.  
1803 had a great time watching this italian-american classic on the big screen complete with whispered fun-fact commentary from my dad, who told me things like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs cosmo‚Äôs brother-in-law from moonstruck‚Äù and ‚Äúwatch closely, this guy‚Äôs teeth fall out‚Äù and ‚Äúbut seriously, you should never treat a woman like that‚Äù 
1804 Good solid filmmaking. A full bodied movie. Cinema. 
1805 michael corleone you will always be famous 
1806 I‚Äôm gonna be honest. I didn‚Äôt expect to like this. But boy, this blew me away. From the writing to the acting it‚Äôs all top notch. This movie immerses you and makes you feel like you‚Äôre right there. Not much I can say that hasn‚Äôt been said.

1812  As a milestone that I watched 24 requested movies before AND as a movie regarded to be one of, if not the best, I feel obligated to make a somewhat lengthy review of this movie. But really, what else is there to say that hasn't been said? It fires on all cylinders. The cinematography is great, the performances are flawless, and even with its dark segments sprinkled throughout, the movie brilliantly interweaves them alongside moments that give it and the‚Ä¶

1814 Amazing way to start off 2022 
1815 Watched for school.I mean, what can I say about this that hasn't been said already? It's The Godfather. One of the most well-regarded movies of all time, and for good reason. Marlon Brando, iconic. Al Pacino, fantastic, along with everyone else too. And the ending is one of the greatest ever.A+ 
1816 Okay so um... That was ok. Like don't get me wrong it's one of the best movies of all time. But it's not one I enjoyed watching particularly. It's amazing, but I think that it isn't for me. 
1817 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   oh yeah well that was fucking brilliant The Godfather is an epic, somewhat tragic masterpiece that I wasn't really sure whether or not I would be calling a masterpiece after watching it. I thought about it for a bit, and have now decided that yeah, it most definitely is a masterpiece!Every single scene in this film is perfection, my favourite scenes were the restaurant scene and the garden scene. I kinda expected what happened in the garden scene, and‚Ä¶   
1818 It‚Äôs a classic, enough said.Grade: A+ 
1819 Watched with the director‚Äôs commentary. Coppola tells stories for 3 hours about all the ways he was doubted and undermined by the studio. It‚Äôs fascinating, but it also loses its effect when basically every scene involves an anecdote about how he was sure he was going to be fired. 
1820 jesus i‚Äôve been quoting the ‚Äúlook how they massacred my boy‚Äù line for years but i never remembered how truly wrenching it was in context, brando‚Äôs anguished face twisted beyond recognition by pain and guilt. what a sad movie. 
1821 i enjoyed pacino's performance in the film jack and jill so i thought i'd check out some of his lesser known movies but this was a huge disappointment. it's wayyy too long and there's not even any poop jokes to make it entertaining. just a mob flick that forces me to try to tell guys apart for 3 hours 
1822  WTF is this shit? ok so i watche dit a long time ago and i remember really liking it, but this is so dumb. First of all bro why is this old man holding a cat thats so cliche and shitty that just proves it right there that this is a shitty film. Also, the acting was shit, every performance in this movie was terrible. Shit writing, shit directing, I cant say something about this movie thats already been said.‚Ä¶  
1823 They copied some things from Sharktale but otherwise very good 
1824 El 13 de Febrero fue un dia historico porque ya vi por primera vez El Padrino y puedo entender porque es una de las mejores peliculas de la historia, es una pelicula que lo tiene todo y bien.

1826 Oh, so it‚Äôs like that one Hannah Montana¬†scene!¬†I have been avoiding The Godfather¬†for so long in fear that it would never live up to the endless references and monstrous reputation. Obviously, it did just that.

1831 I think this movie is good. 
1832 THIS IS WITHOUT DOUBT, THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE! 
1833 It‚Äôs just perfect.¬†Coppola successfully delivers a sharp and entertaining story, with some perfectly molded characters, amazing performances by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino (and probably every single actor on the film), stunning production and a quote that had prevailed to this day. A timeless and exquisitely crafted mob classic. It does live to its hype, and will continue to do so. 
1834 üåπ 
1835  All right, where do I start? The Godfather film series have been on my watchlist since I was 15 or so. I deliberately postponed watching this movie, like many other classics. I just need to pick a good time and really be on my own to experience this movie to the fullest. During the first scenes of the film you immediately get in touch with Italian life. You feel the love, the warmth and the pure authenticity, all values that‚Ä¶

1840 yes i finally watched this movie in theaters and i think it was one of the best experiences of my life. yes i did cry seeing how michael goes from being a sweet kid to the head of a crime organization. yes i did cry seeing al pacino‚Äôs beautiful face. i can‚Äôt really put into words how much this movie means to me, i just know no other movie will ever compare 
1841 Strictly family business. 
1842 Even though some gunshots, stunts and performances have not aged as good as I remembered, the film in itself is an absolute masterclass in visual storytelling. A film that has been, is and will be replicated and honoured for centuries to come.Marlon Brand & Pacino are sublime. 
1843  Despu√©s de ver El Padrino muchisimas veces sigo corroborando que es una de las mejores pel√≠culas de la historia del cine. Si historia, su ambientaci√≥n, sus personajes tan iconicos y tan bien interpretados y su direcci√≥n tan perfecta.El Padrino es un 10 en todos sus apartados, una direcci√≥n magistral en todas las escenas y todo llenos de escenas para la historia. Se podr√≠a estar hablando de esta pel√≠cula por siglos y habr√≠a muy poco que pudiese acercarse a ella.‚Ä¶  
1844  This is a very well-made movie. Obviously, it's one of the best movies of all-time according to most people, and I too loved it. The story is weaved together so well, and Al Pacino and Marlon Brando did the best they probably could've with their roles. They were pretty fantastic. I thought the theme of family was very interesting to watch, and I also think the theme is going to be relatable to just about anyone with a good relationship‚Ä¶  
1845 Christopher Nolan woke up one morning with a horse head in his bed and that‚Äôs how Harry Styles ended up in Dunkirk. 
1846 I came very, very close to hating this. The first hour for me, personally, was uninteresting and I couldn‚Äôt make out half of what Marlon Brando was saying.. BUT then the film progressed and the new Don was crowned.¬†Honestly, a crime drama masterpiece.

1850  10/10Note: For my top three best films, I am attempting to go in depth in my review. This is #2.My ExperienceThe first time I watched this film, I liked it quite a bit, but was a bit bored by parts of it. It thought it was objectively a masterpiece, but I didn't care for it much subjectively. It is worth mentioning that the viewing was on a computer screen. About a year later, in the summer of‚Ä¶  
1851   You talk about vengeance. Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me?#11 of BFI's top 101 films of all time.Coppola's tragedian epic is a baggy, rotting picture. At times, it threatens to spill out past the borders of the screen right onto its audience's lap. It's a film that attempts to capture the life, death, and rebirth of a legendary criminal, a prolific businessman, and, most of all: a father. Coppola‚Ä¶  
1852  First of all, I can't begin to say anything without thanking a good friend I have made through cinema. Truman, who has told me about screenings of my favorite films at the Tribeca Film Festival for two years in a row, gave me two nights that will never leave me, and some of the best nights of my life.The Godfather is now a film I have truly come to understand and appreciate more than ever. I would be so‚Ä¶  
1853 i love my smol son michael corleone 
1854  A mafia-mold of grit and assassination. The war of the families. Corleones unite. Offers you cant refuse. The seamless epic that is The Godfather, Francis Ford Coppola's beautifully mastered tale of Italian organized crime, revenge, and power. A hard-boiled classic in every sense, better with each unprecedented viewing, this is the essence of superior film-making, being transported into a realistic world and taking a peek into the enclosed nature within the rarest of life. This was the revitalization of the‚Ä¶  
1855  There's nothing I can add to the towering praises heaped upon this film that hasn't already been said before. ¬†It's elegant, quiet, tense (the hospital stairwell scene had my heart pounding), extraordinarily acted (especially Pacino, Caan, and late stage Brando), has some great characters and relationships (Sonny and Michael being perhaps the most interesting), the iconic scenes hold up even better in context (the horse head moment is horrific, the slow paced reveal is great), it's an all around great‚Ä¶  
1856 A book-length exegesis could, or perhaps should, be written about Michael Corleone, a character that is to the movies what Hamlet is to the theater. 
1857 What is there left to say about The Godfather? I just want to focus on one of many great characters that inhabit the film: Mark McCluskey.This NYPD captain is played pitch-perfectly by veteran actor Stirling Hayden, who imbues the corrupt, racist and thuggish officer of the law with more than a hint of self-loathing. McCluskey is not in The Godfather all that much ‚Äì just two scenes, I think, but what scenes they are, especially his last.Mr Hayden, I salute you, sir. 
1858 The Golden Age of Television began here. All the shows we love are just cribbing from what Coppola and his collaborators pulled off with this film. 
1859 UMMM THIS IS DEDICATED TO THE PEOPLE WHO TOLD ME I WAS A BAD FILM√â BUFF!!!! ¬†FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA WAS LITERALLY A FUCKING FOOT AWAY FROM ME!!!!!!!!!

1860 One of the greatest films ever made to not pass the Bechdel test.(Marlon Brando could STILL get it in this movie, even in that make up) 
1861 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Hailed as one of the greatest movies of all time, I figured it would be only fitting that I finally sat down and watched for Al Pacino's 75th Birthday!! It's the film that put him on the map after all. I LOVED IT!!!I can honestly see why it's so beloved, and for a movie that was at least three hours long, that went by pretty fast!!! It all flowed so well! Prepare yourselves when I say this, I love it‚Ä¶   
1862 A flawless piece of filmmaking, "The Godfather" still remains riveting, spectacularly-acted, and directed to perfection. Each scene packs so much information in, but it's always easy to follow. The film also contains one of the most well-developed arcs of a character ever put to film. 
1863  Expressing a distaste for The Godfather is the equivalent of pissing into the ocean. It's such a frivolous endeavour, and will always end with you having to address that fact of its own frivolity - piss all you like but the ocean will remain untainted in the long run.So blah blah the cinematography is pretty good, if not a little bland, and most of the acting is spot on, save for Marlon Brando, whose cotton-mouthed mumble-formance has been saturated‚Ä¶  
1864  Included In Lists:Strong Performances - Marlon BrandoSight and Sound Top 250 - #23Regarded as one of the most important and influential films of the century. This film has definitely changed the way gangster films are created. Back in the golden days of cinema, gangster films were notable for their violence and profanity.

Citizen Kane in 1941 reinvented cinematography, set design and film production on larger scales. 2001: A Space Odyssey started the Sci-Fi revolution in film, and was arguably the first commercially and critically successful blockbuster.

1869 this is like the godfather of movies 
1870  MRC: 4/31Considerada como la mejor pel√≠cula de la historia, "El Padrino" descubri√≥ que el g√©nero de gangsteres no era s√≥lo un g√©nero m√°s, sino que lo que le da realmente importancia no es la premisa (que tambi√©n) , sino la moralizaci√≥n de los personajes. Se ve que Coppola le puso empe√±o en sacar provecho a la psicolog√≠a de cada miembro de las mafias (perdon, "familias") que se presentan, porque el personaje m√°s carism√°tico es el "jefe" de la "familia",‚Ä¶  
1871  Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.¬†Shocking! And sad! And so violent, but also (surprisingly) really funny! This was my first time watching this movie and I got to see it at the theater‚ÄîI fucking loved it.¬†Quite literally a perfect film. I was completely locked into these characters and all of their wild arcs from the very beginning all the way to the very last scene. There are so many great characters, but obviously watching Michael‚Äôs transformation over these 3‚Ä¶  
1872 I mean it‚Äôs funny when you see old people young and they‚Äôre hot. Pacino I‚Äôm looking at you. Oh and the story.. yeah it was pretty good too.

1876  "Leave the Gun. Take the Cannoli"Part of me hoped I would come out of this with a spicy take so I could be a contrarian asshole BUT! I got nothing... Just a feeling of great shame for how long I had put off watching itAnd while I could gush about a lil something in each and every scene, what would be the point?

1878 the kind of movie that makes you want to readjust all your other ratings just to show how exceptional it is.my dad has waited 19 years to be able to watch his favorite trilogy with one of his children and i can say that this did nothing but exceed my expectations. extra half star for the smile on his face and his fun fact commentary every 3 minutes. sorry that cousin geoff didn‚Äôt appreciate it nearly as much when he was my age 
1879 I mean, it‚Äôs The¬†Godfather. Vito Corleone is an all time character with an all time performance by Brando. Simply iconic. 
1880  The Godfather is a slow burning crime drama. It‚Äôs the original. A groundbreaking and genre-shifting film considered by many to be the greatest of all time. Since this was released in 1972, gangster movies have developed. Directors and actors have built upon this genre. Goodfellas, The Departed, Casino. All these fantastic films often with similar casts took elements from The Godfather and catered to an audience that had seen what came before. My mistake was watching these before The Godfather.‚Ä¶  
1881 98/100Still can‚Äôt review. Seriously. Taxi Driver and Shawshank Redemption¬†are great and all, but if we‚Äôre talking objectively this is definitely the best film ever made. Still not MY #1, but Jesus this is a masterpiece

1887 michael and vito corleone are just the greatest characters ever written 
1888  For a film that's (rightly) regarded as one of the all-time great American films, it's Coppola's decision to include the more naturalistic and smaller details that makes this American epic such a darkly never ending joy; from how to prepare a meal for forty guys, to the sound that the gun makes that Michael uses on The Turk and McClusky, to the look on Kay's face that takes us into the end credits, the list is literally endless.Some might‚Ä¶

I'm going to say that right here <great stuff>. No need to write it all out though. But, I will say this: this is debated as the best movie ever made, and to me, this barely felt like a movie at all.

1893  ¬®I`ll make him an offer he can`t refuse.¬®Many people consider the 70`s to be the Golden Age in Cinema, and if that is the case then Francis Ford Coppola had a great deal to do with it. During that decade he directed The Godfather Part 1 and 2, The Conversation, and Apocalypse Now; he also produced American Graffiti, and wrote the screenplay for Patton. During that time he won 5 Oscars and was nominated for another seven. At least‚Ä¶

1895 Honestly I don't know what else to say except is just a good movie. Mike's writting and character development is some of the best I've ever seen. The story is engaging. Just all around solid.I do understand why so many people give this movie a 5 star but for me it does lack that special something, maybe just cause I'm not much of a mobster movie fan. Solid 4.5 tho, Coppola the goat, and I'm excited to watch Part 2. 
1896 ''I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.'' 
1897  Clearly a paramount of cinema but for me i really don‚Äôt think it is as good as everyone claims it is, of course it is incredibly well written and acted but for me it‚Äôs missing some of that spark that made films such as Goodfellas so good, it is filled with iconic moments and quotes that even someone who hasn‚Äôt seen the film will recognise which clearly shows how world renown and influential this film is, Marlon Brando gives an‚Ä¶

1900  I didn't like this in high school, nor did I respond to it in college when I tried again. I never ‚Äúgot‚Äù it and found it boring. But finally, on this watch, it clicked for me. It's a fluid, elegant, and richly detailed crime saga, with the ability to pull you in with ease and force, an ability that I can now recognize as timeless.I highly doubt there's anything for me to add to everything that's been said about‚Ä¶

1908 meus amigos, incrivelmente bom. surreal o quanto o roteiro desse filme me prendeu, por mais que seja extenso n√£o perdi a aten√ß√£o por um minuto. a trama me transferiu uma sensa√ß√£o de ang√∫stia por n√£o saber o que iria acontecer com os personagens nesse meio t√£o conturbado.¬†michael corleone sem sobra de d√∫vidas deixou essa obra muito melhor, todo o enredo que envolve ele √© incr√≠vel. ansioso pra ver os pr√≥ximos e sigo com as expectativas altas, coppola fez hist√≥ria. 
1909 it's the way that i SCREAMED the minute Al Pacino appeared and continued to scream to all of his scenes. 
1910  Now I know this is classed as one of the best movies of all time and I‚Äôm not disputing that, I just personally found it hard to stay engaged and enjoy the film. It‚Äôs not because of the film itself, but because this genre is not one that I typically enjoy and I find it hard to stay focused. I have chronic fatigue and with The Godfather‚Äôs duration and lots of slow dialogue scenes, it causes me to get incredibly‚Ä¶  
1911  I first watched The Godfather when I was 18 years old, with the OG film buff in my family, my grandfather. It was right before I started college, and it had a major impact on me at the time ‚Äì undoubtedly the reason I acted a little too ganster during my first week in undergrad.More than 8 years on, I decided to read the book on a complete whim.

1915 Have you ever watched a movie that has been hyped up to hell and back, and you go in expecting it to be overrated, before realizing that it's actually phenomenal? Well that wasn't me, I knew this would be great and it still blew my expectations away. I have ADHD, and it makes movies tough sometimes, but these 3 hours flew past while I was watching a gripping story filled with every Italian heavy hitter actor in Hollywood. Perfectly acted, shot, actually scary at times, while being engaging all throughout. It's hardly even worth hyping this film up, you already know it's great 
1916  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna make him an offer he can‚Äôt refuse.‚Äù‚ÄùIt‚Äôs not personal , Sonny. Its strictly business.‚Äù‚ÄúLook how they massacred my boy.‚ÄùThis is the film of all films.They most quotable film of all time.Rewatched this before watching part 2 it was 100% better than i remembered it.Marlon Brando brings in what i believe to be the greatest acting performance of all time and he‚Äôs not even they main protagonist. Don Vito Corleone is they most‚Ä¶

1918 finally had the time to watch this. it's as great as everyone says it is. it's gritty, tragic, gripping, and fascinating. can't wait to see part 2. 
1919 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   The Godfather might be one of the most difficult movies to talk about. Not because of its subject matter although it is violent. No it's hard to talk about because it's one of those movies that everything that needs to be said about it has already been said. It's called one of the best movies of all time if not the greatest and it's not hard to see why. Centering around the Mafia family The Corleone's it chronicles their lives‚Ä¶   
1920 i had no idea what was going on the entire time. 5 stars! 
1921  "Where's Michael?"Despite this being a story of violent thugs, the emphasis on family, and in particular the father and the son, elevate it beyond mere gangster flick. The father, the son, the blessing, the inheritance, and of course, generational sin. This is Biblical stuff.Michael does not want to follow in his father's footsteps. He wants to make his own way. However, as we later see in Part II, this was a youthful arrogance that could never last. What‚Ä¶

1929 a true masterpiece *chefs kiss*. 
1930 I NEEDED to rewatch this after the abhorrent mainstream, dad joined along and we had the best three hours together, Father‚Äôs Day done right I think, I‚Äôm sure Michael would agree 
1931 Ontem, s√°bado, tirei o dia para rever dois dos meus grandes favoritos da vida. Assim como 'The Best Years Of Our Lives', assistir 'The Godfather' √© sempre viver as mesmas emo√ß√µes. Acho que dispensa coment√°rios. S√≥ sei que amo a saga da fam√≠lia Corleone. 
1932 our house a day after the annual godfather rewatch :/‚Äúnoya could you pass me the cerea-‚Äú‚ÄúWHAT DO YA THINK THIS IS THE ARMY WHERE YOU SHOOT EM A MILE AWAY YOU GOTTA GET UP CLOSE LIKE THIS BADABING YOU BLOW THEIR BRAINS ALL OVER THEIR NICE IVY LEAGUE SUITS‚Äùüí•üôäüí£ 
1933 i remember when i thought the godfather would be one of those movies i watched once and then be done with but apparently since first watching it in december i‚Äôve seen it 6 times... and i know whose influence that is down to. and if they‚Äôre reading this they also know who they are ‚ù§Ô∏è 
1934 Watched in 4K.I‚Äôm so glad we get to watch and experience this film in such a high quality, this is one of the greatest things cinema has to offer.Pickup this new 4K trilogy set if you can, as soon as possible. 
1935 Keaton‚Äôs red coat and hat my favorite costume ever.

1938 Yeah yeah you‚Äôve all seen it, what‚Äôs to say?Unless you were young and fortunate enough to see it theatrically upon its release, then you‚Äôve never seen it in this way, the 4K way!I‚Äôve owned it on VHS, DVD and Blu-Ray, but the latest restoration undertaken to get it to this 50th Anniversary incarnation is utter sorcery.The film is sublime and the epitome of perfection, but now it‚Äôs in a state that befits its status and just deserves to be seen to be believed.Lay down your money on the offer that you cannot refuse and thank me later‚Ä¶

1944 was supposed to be working on my senior project for culinary with this as background noise but the only food costs i ended up calculating was how fat exactly is michael corleone‚Äôs ass per metric ton 
1945 Managed to catch a cinema viewing and the restoration completely blew me away. As for the film itself‚Ä¶it‚Äôs still the greatest of all time‚Ä¶nothing more to say 
1946 yay i finally watched the godfather!!just after it finished i wasn‚Äôt really thinking ‚Äúwow that was an amazing film‚Äù. but now it‚Äôs like 5-6 hrs later and i haven‚Äôt stopped thinking about it. it‚Äôs really got into my brain in a way a film hasn‚Äôt for a long time.¬†also the cat at the beginning was so adorable!! i heard a story about brando keeping the cat and i hope it‚Äôs true.¬†looking forward to watching part II next week :) 
1947 Only don't tell me you're innocent. Because it insults my intelligence and makes me very angry.Watching this on the big screen was one of the finest moments on my life. My love for this film is completely endless, it‚Äôs perfect. ¬†I teared up because of how amazing it felt to be in that moment. That‚Äôs special. Cinema is special. Quite possibly the most perfect film ever, to me at least. 
1948 I'm so glad I managed to book the screening with nicer chairs as I don't think my ass could of taken all 3 hours of this in a normal screening 
1949 Truly spectacular to watch this in the cinema with my dad - so much better on the big screen! A link to my previous review. 
1950  Yes, it‚Äôs very good. Not much else to say‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the ultimate homage to the gangster movies that came before and the blueprint for everything that came after. But maybe I‚Äôll just say a few things that particularly struck me this time watching it on a big ass screen in a packed theater:For one, Everyone gives gives credit to the wedding or the hit job scenes as standouts, but for my money, that garden scene as Vito plays with‚Ä¶  
1951  Hard to find a 3 hour film that feels more jam packed with action, doesn‚Äôt waste a shot and leaves me drooling to spend 6 more hours viewing the rest of the trilogy.¬†Al Pacino‚Äôs performance as Michael Corleone was air tight, deadly precision. He‚Äôs got those crazy eyes you can just see straight into his characters soul through.¬†So many quotable lines and scenes that have been referenced in pop culture ad nauseum. This movie is a giant. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶  
1952 I was finally able to watch this on the big screen. I had no idea how dark Gordon Willis‚Äô iconic cinematography could be until today. The restoration is magnificent.¬†And‚Ä¶ what else can I say? It‚Äôs THE FUCKING GODFATHER. 
1953 Clemenza: ‚ÄúLeave the gun. Take the cannoli.‚ÄùA masterpiece of narrative storytelling, brilliant cinematography and one of the greatest casts ever assembled. From opening shot to last shot, I wouldn‚Äôt change a second in between.¬†I‚Äôve been watching this movie on TV since 1984, but tonight I saw the new Dolby Digital remaster on the big screen for the first time and it was like my first time again. Every time I see it I seem to see something new, which is the mark of great filmmaking. If you get the chance to see this on your local big screen don‚Äôt miss it. 
1954  There aren't enough hours in the day to write about and do justice towards Francis Ford Coppola's multi-layered seminal epic that tells the story of a generational family saga. I could wax lyrical about how Coppola hijacks your emotions with the simplest techniques of blocking, composition and framing; how cinematographer Gordon Willis creates such a rich and dynamic atmosphere with low key lighting (so much so that he was dubbed the Prince of Darkness for his characteristic use of chiaroscuro‚Ä¶  
1955  yayi‚Äôve wanted to make time to watch this for so long and i‚Äôm so glad i finally grew up and just rented it because i was having a pretty awful day today and this really lifted my spirits :)¬†i‚Äôm actually not going to talk about the direction or cinematography or writing or score or anything like that because there‚Äôs literally nothing i can say that hasn‚Äôt been said before !¬†this movie reminded me of one of the‚Ä¶  
1956  In a nutshell:(XL nutshell)üçäüêà¬†* Lenny Montana (Luca Brasi) was so nervous about working with Marlon Brando that in the first take of their scene together, he choked on his lines. Director Francis Ford Coppola liked the genuine nervousness & built it into the film, the scene of Luca practicing his speech was added later. Brando‚Äôs performance is essential viewing, tempered, subtle, but also powerful & exposing. It‚Äôs also wonderful to see a young Al Pacino go toe to toe‚Ä¶  
1957 Watched The Godfather. I'm a certified cinephile now. Respect that. 
1958 I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs taken me so long to watch this film. It really is everything it‚Äôs hyped up to be, I don‚Äôt have much to add that hasn‚Äôt already been said about this film but I have to at least mention that baptism scene because that¬†really is top tier cinema. 
1959 Figured I had to watch them sooner or later, and holy shit the score is something else. I could sink right into any moment of it and be at peace.¬†Great and subtle (but¬†full-tilt when it wants to be), I imagine everyone says pretty much the same thing. Can‚Äôt wait to see Michael go sicko mode. I enjoy slow builds in character pieces but your franchise can‚Äôt be just repression. This isn‚Äôt Star Wars. 
1960 I had ages to watch this and I decided to rewatch. More eager for Godfather II cause I've seen it only one time and not full. I watched the second half due to a mistake of the video club I had rent it and after some days I watche dthe first half too. So I have a weird experience with that film. Can't wait, rewatching it tomorrow.

1970  I think it bothers me how filmbros act over this movie bcuz it‚Äôs 100% warranted and i‚Äôd be all over that...but they have to be so weird and incel-y about it that makes me want to run the opposite direction any time someone brings it up.Anyways, this movie is so good like the way the tension builds and the acting just everything is so good.

1973 I Believe in America.The Godfather is my favourite of the trilogy.Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo masterfully craft a detailed world of family and crime setting the tone as Al Pacino's Michael Corleone has to decide between a life of his own or to follow in his family's criminal footsteps.Every shot, every scene, every character is iconic - the filmmakers have created a world that feels so lived in with such rich characters that you can't help but root for despite being inherently terrible people.A tale of legacy that lives on almost 50 years later. 
1974 in all fairness the simpsons have absolutely ruined this for me, could not take an ounce of this seriously

1976  About as pivotal and developmental in my life as any other film fanatic or filmmaker, but even then, what‚Äôs to say? What can I possibly add to ‚ÄúThe Godfather,‚Äù a film that sits comfortably in my top pantheon of favorite films and a film that changed the ballgame, that already hasn‚Äôt been said? The answer is simple ‚Äì nothing. Nothing can be said to even create some sort of controversy surrounding ‚ÄúThe Godfather‚Äù or bring some little anecdote about the‚Ä¶

1978 5 things: 1. A few years ago, an older cousin told me that any lesson a man may need for his life was contained in Rocky and The Godfather. I did not understand that in that moment, but I do now.2. Tom Hagen is a sweetheart and I love him3. I really like the way people die in these movies. It straddles the fine line between verosimile and melodramatic.4. This is how the color black should look in movies, not the bland, grey shit we get nowadays.5. God, i'm turning into a boomer 
1979 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   The opening of The Godfather primarily focuses on two scenes - the first and more overt being the brightly lit, picturesque beauty of a wedding reception, where Coppola spends valuable runtime in order to establish the strong bonds of familial affection running between the Corleone family. However, the ostensible scenic charm of this joyful occasion is swiftly undercut by the interspersed moments spent in a dimly lit interior room, in which the godfather himself, Vito Corleone, carries out negotiations with‚Ä¶

1981 E' difficile persino parlare di qualcosa di cos√¨ monumentale ed influente come Il padrino.Posso solo dire di essere rimasto stupito da quanto, ha dispetto delle mie aspettative, sia un racconto estremamente sobrio, che sintetizza in tre ore almeno dieci anni di storie, affiancando uno dopo l'altro stralci di storia criminale, familiare ed americana (e non).Un film che prende vita grazie al suo cast leggendario, usato con assoluta moderazione, tempi narrativi perfetti ed una fotografia d'altri tempi.Mi riservo mezza stella per il prossimo capitolo.

1987 Revisiting this masterpiece years later after I've matured and grown just hits different. I learned so much about business and life in general. This is probably my 5th watch. I appreciate it more every time I watch it. It is, without any exaggerations, in the top 3 best films of all time. It's not debatable. Monumental. 
1988 It's one of those films that holds up even better on rewatch.I've breezed through it and it never felt that its run time was almost 3 hours. It definitely still is one of the greatest films of all time. 
1989 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Watched this to understand why it was known as one of the most highly-rated films of all time. I am not into the crime genre much but I ended up liking this more than I should.Michael staying low-key mostly in the entire movie and doing that killing spree in the ending is so satisfying to watch. It's similar to a mood when something just snapped inside of you and you wake up one day being done with everyone's bullshit. And really, I could watch that entire bloody revenge scene over and over. It's just brilliant!  
1990 masterpiece! 
1991  One of the best films of all-time. #2 on my list specifically. I know it‚Äôs a cliche to say, but I‚Äôve never been a fan of discounting popular works of art simply because they‚Äôre popular. That's a weird notion to me. And THE GODFATHER has more than earned its reputation. Its juxtaposition on violence as it relates to a father and son is as emotionally gripping as it is dramatically riveting. At its heart, THE GODFATHER is less a crime‚Ä¶  
1992 i had a dream where i rewatched the film in its entirety yesterday. the universe had made me an offer i can‚Äôt refuse, so i did what i had to do 
1993 Of course 5 stars, it's the fucking godfather. 
1994 2 weddings and a funeral. I've always had a soft spot for epic's. When an epic is done well, I get so much need to make films. I actually did like Apocalypse Now more. I know I shouldn't compare, but I just did. Ahh I'm already missing watching The Godfather it a little. Just the feel of this non stop motion. One thing leading to the other. But you can only watch a film once for the first time. 
1995 funny how when the filmbros critique and praise this they always go for the same points yet fail to mention how fit young al pacino is üòó‚úåÔ∏è 
1996 Goodfellas is better¬†Edited: 4.5 -> 4 
1997 Francis Ford Coppola‚Äôs masterpiece sees the Corleone family fighting for dominance in 40‚Äôs New York as the head of the family played iconically by Marlon Brando considers retirement after an attempt on his life and young Michael Corleone begins his ascent. ¬†So much to love about this movie, this pretty much became the blueprint of every mob movie and TV show since. ¬†Loved James Caan in this. 
1998 Truly one of the best movies of all time, and I'm so lucky I was able to see The Godfather in theaters. I've officially seen both of the films in theaters, and it definitely does add to the experience. I also got to say how much I loved Al Pacino to a random employee at the theater.My one critique is the theater I watched it in cut off the subtitles for some reason and it really irritated me. 
1999 I had the honor of seeing this in theatres today.There really isn't much to say about the film itself that hasn't been said already.One thing that struck me on this rewatch is how much the mob used to resemble the royal family in obvious and not-so-obvious ways. As in, the ethics, the organization and quite honestly even the "reliance" on the mob to sustain the economy. It's the closest America got to having a monarchy.I can honestly never get enough of this movie. 
2000 There's a scene where following a stressful encounter Michael Corleone lights a cigarette and his hands are not shaking. He notices that they aren't. That right there is when he became the Don. 
2001  There‚Äôs a reason why this is considered one of the all time best. This epic tale of a mafia family is as thrilling now as it was back in 1972. Not a moment wasted, the characters are all compelling and the plot is marvellous. The characters are well rounded, and even some of the smaller characters in the film have charm and a reason. They are all memorable, with some of the most memorable movie quotes of all time. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm‚Ä¶  
2002 Since entering this app I wanted to make an analysis of the godfather's trilogy, but I preferred to wait to read the book, I admire how Francis Ford Coppola handled the story of Don Vito and his family, it is unique and unmatched, I think I am facing the best movie well adapted to 100% of a book, you can call me crazy or exaggerated, but I loved it and it became fast in one of my favorite trilogies almost surpasses the lord of the rings. 
2003 "i will make you an offer you can't refuse".i am just in a gangster movie mood.

2005 all the same middle aged white guy with slightly different italian names how can i keep track of all of them...love u tho al pacino ü§ù 
2006 Nach der Erstsichtung vor ungef√§hr 16-17 Jahren fand ich "Der Pate" nur okay - er war mir damals vor allem zu langatmig -, aber nach jeder weiteren Sichtung mochte ich Ihn mehr. Nun, nachdem ich den Film ungef√§hr zum 5. Mal gesehen habe, erkenne ich Ihn auch als subjektives (und nat√ºrlich objektives-) Meisterwerk an! 
2007 What a PHENOMENAL work of art. 
2008 The performances alone justify this as one of the all-time classics. It's a movie that demands obsession, and it's one that I haven't watched nearly enough. I know this isn't the most in-depth review, but I feel like I've got a much better one in me someday, and I'm just glad to have started my 20th year on a fantastic note. 
2009 I mean, of course I'd give this a 5/5. It would be a fucking disgrace if I didn't.The 5/5 rating doesn't mean it's fully perfect, but goddamn does it come extremely close. 
2010 (Watched on restored 35mm.)As an observer, I love this movie-- it's well crafted, has an incredible atmosphere, and the world it depicts is perversely fascinating.What I long for when I watch a movie, though, isn't just to be an observer but to get pulled into the soul of the story, and that's where The Godfather has always fallen short with me.I think that Michael Corleone is probably the heart of this movie, but if he is, why don't we find out more about him?

2012  The Passing of the Torch.When The Prince Charles Cinema put on a 35mm Godfather Trilogy screening, it was an offer I couldn't refuse.The Godfather is not only one of the greatest films of all time because of its masterful storytelling, attention to detail or incredible performances. It has the lasting factor to stand out amongst the rest over almost 50 years later.I let the film sit for a few days and I found myself repeatedly coming back‚Ä¶  
2013  It had been so long since I‚Äôd last seen this, that my only memory of the film was a haze of famous lines and referenced moments. So for all intents and purposes, this was my first time watching The Godfather, old enough to fully understand and appreciate it.Compared to the many movies that have followed in its wake, what stands out about The Godfather is how deliberate it is. The classic crime epic moves at such a measured pace,‚Ä¶  
2014 The Reputation Stadium Tour: A Netflix Original Special is so much better than this 
2015 Great movie but I also have like the shortest attention span EVERRRRRR 
2016 i relate to vito corleone because i too would call out for al pacino when i‚Äôm lying in bed sick 
2017 Pacino's the lead, Brando's supporting, the Oscars really should issue a formal apology any day now 
2018  ‚ÄúI believe in America.‚Äù Thus begins one of the greatest achievements in cinema, the prototypical mafia movie (aside from perhaps ‚ÄòGoodfellas‚Äô), the most iconic mafia leader in movies, Don Corleone played by the icon himself Marlon Brando. Five stars. 
2019 I finally watched this at age 35. Good stuff. Episodic storytelling rarely feels so effortless, so natural. The restaurant assassination is one of the most tense sequences in any gangster movie I've ever seen. Brando really is great in this, but Robert Duvall might be the standout. Can't wait to see part 2. 
2020 I trusted you, Nicky. I welcomed you into my home. We broke bread together. Granmama made you a cannoli. And how did you repay my generosity? With a rug. Made from the butt of a skunk. A skunk butt rug. You disrespected me. You disrespected my Granmama, whom I buried in that skunk butt rug. 
2021 My Ode to Sicily Marathon continues with the Godfather trilogy!The Godfather gets better with each watch, if that's possible. This is my third rewatch, and I just keep noticing more and more subtle things.Michael Corleone's character arc is, quite frankly, the best one I've ever witnessed. The baptism scene! The ending! Oh my god!!!If I ever wanted to become a screenwriter or director, the brilliance of this movie is what I would try to emulate. Holy cannoli. 
2022  It was thrilling to finally see this on the big screen! Unlike many, I have only seen the film a few times. It had been so long that I'd forgotten many scenes.I wish I could see Part 2 this way. I've always preferred 2, but 1 may be in the lead now just because it's so much better at the cinema.I have a couple of quibbles for those who know more or have opinions.Why is Appolonia necessary‚Ä¶  
2023  watched in theaters(!)An absolute masterpiece of storytelling and filmmaking, The Godfather, is, put simply, one excellent, transfixing, beautiful scene after another. And another. And another and another and another.. FOR THREE HOURS! That's fucking insane!And all of it's fascinating. So captivatingly real. More times than not it feels more documentary than scripted.Take a look at that wedding scene. WHAT?? This was staged?? Feels like stock footage (albeit Gordon-Willis-shot stock footage) straight out of an actual Italian wedding.‚Ä¶  
2024 It's not a coincidence that baby Sofia Coppola was in the best scene......queen of cinemaEdit: I drove home in the pouring rain listening to the soundtrack and it was the best moment of my life 
2025  Grad School Prep 1/34It's a shame that, in an attempt to figure out why this film is such a classic, all I seemed to find where comments along the lines of, "what a gem! Don't need to say anything that's already been said!"Well... what's been said, lol.The best answer I came across is that this is some kind of perfect example of the American Dream realized. idk maybe this was the first film of its kind to‚Ä¶

2027 There will never be a greater mob film for as long as human beings exist 
2028  I was due for a rewatch ages ago. I saw Godfather in high school and was unimpressed. It was a significantly slower pace than the Scorsese gangster pictures I was used to. As an adult with more patience and understanding of what this film meant to the genre, I found the excitement and thrill I missed as a teenager. I found the movie very intense which is what made it most enjoyable. Even though I remembered most of the big‚Ä¶

2031 I would write a review for this movie, but words cannot explain how great this film is. 
2032 I've thought long and hard, and searched high and low; and I honestly cannot find a single flaw in The Godfather.Pure perfection. 
2033 aw man i was all ready to hate this 
2034 I stayed awake the whole time! Couple of close calls... but we made it 
2035 Only just watched it now but it was great. Anyone have recommendations for films like this and even similar to my favourite 4? 
2036 i want to make michael an offer he can‚Äôt refuse 
2037 Watched in 2023 - Film 275This probably sounds really dumb but I forgot how good James Caan and Al Pacino are in this. Also, Al Pacino does something to me (an alleged lesbian). 
2038  back at it baby !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the incredible thing about this film is that there is just so much to talk about always, it's incredible the depth of thought and care that was put into it by everyone involved, even if to the point of insanity. there's something to be said for rewatching a film when you know so much about how it was made ‚Äî mostly that it's incredibly funny (al pacino thinking that he was going to be fired‚Ä¶  
2039 Dear Marlon Brando, you continue to amaze me time and time again.  
2040  I feel like the first time I watched this I was probably a babymy family‚Äôs Italian and so I already know I‚Äôve talked way too much about the weird-ass things they do‚Äî and apparently one of those is just not giving a fuck about having THE GODFATHER movies playing almost 24/7 as I grew up‚Äî but who cares‚Äî it‚Äôs probably a big part of why I love movies as much as I dowhat can you even say anymore‚Ä¶

2042 Never gets old 
2043  I will not utter the three word phrase that everyone under the sun uses when talking about this excellent film.First time that I've seen this in probably four years, give or take? One of those films, like for many of us on this site I'm sure, that I watched as I was beginning to get into really appreciating the craft of cinema. It must've been around late 2018, because the memory I have seeing this for the first time‚Ä¶  
2044 Not really sure what I was thinking when I gave this a 7/10. 
2045 too many italians 
2046 italians seem great! i wish they were real.

2048 The beauty of The Godfather is the perfect balance between crime and humanity. Bumping it up to a 10/10 on this viewing.

2050  50 Jahre THE GODFATHERHeute vor genau 50 Jahren, also am 14.03.1972 feierte dieser Meilenstein der Filmgeschichte seine Weltpremiere und ich konnte ihn anl√§sslich dieses Jubil√§ums zum ersten mal in meinem Leben im Kino auf der gro√üen Leinwand genie√üen.¬†Verdammt, dieser Film wird einfach nicht alt.¬†Definitiv einer der besten Filme aller Zeiten.¬†Viel mehr kann und muss ich zu diesem Film nicht sagen, das haben andere schon zu gen√ºge getan und vorallem finden sie auch die besseren Worte f√ºr‚Ä¶  
2051 ya sabemos lo impecable que es esta pel√≠cula en todos los aspectos posibles, todo es perfecto. pero verla de nuevo pero esta vez en el cine hace que todo se potencie. que fortuna ver una de las mejores pel√≠culas de la historia del cine en la pantalla grande.¬†* se para y aplaude *

2054 i wish italian people were real.. 
2055 Holly shit. Estoy seriamente considerando bajar la nota a todas mis pel√≠culas registradas (aunque no, qu√© flojera jaja). No s√© que m√°s puedo aportar, pero lo bueno es que cumpl√≠ un sue√±o m√°s: ver El Padrino en el cine.Solo faltan La La Land (s√≠, la vi en mi casa, voy a llorar), Pulp Fiction, Schlinder's List y Psycho.Es que todo est√° excelente, no puede seeer.Las mejores 3 horas que he vivido en el cine.Btw, Al Pacino > Marlon Brando (en la pel√≠cula). 
2056  I mean.... it's the Godfather. I don't know what else I have to say. Is it my favorite film ever made? I mean it's in my top 10 now but no. However, is this the greatest movie ever made? In my eyes, 100%. This movie is flawless, the acting is perfect, the story is brilliant, the pacing is great, seriously this film is 3 hours long and yet it never drags somehow. The characters are all fleshed out and memorable,‚Ä¶  
2057  Everyone has their first picture that captivate them into the art of film and I think for me it was The Godfather. I often struggled in life trying to find what my true passion is and I essentially just went through different phases and career path ideas. However, everytime I would just burn out and I reached the point in life where I started thinking that I'd never find my true passion and went down a really dark phase just‚Ä¶  
2058  The Godfather is GODly cinema!Haha slap that quote on a poster!It‚Äôs practically a rite of passage as a cinephile to watch The Godfather. We are talking about monumental touchstones of American movie-making, that marries a thoughtful and slow-burn auteur driven sensibility with a populist ¬†violent melodrama about the tragic overtones of falling victim to the lust for power and money.It‚Äôs the opening titles where we are introduced to one of The Godfather‚Äôs many iconic features, the musical‚Ä¶  
2059  My 1000 film on Letterboxd! We did it you guys.I was cautious when I started the movie. Many thoughts were on my mind, maybe it is good but overhyped? Maybe it hadn't aged well? I told a friend I was gonna watch this and he said it is " a movie for straight people", one of those that appeal to the male fantasy and are not as great as people say (I then realized he has never watched it).‚Ä¶  
2060 it‚Äôs not for me, i‚Äôm sorry everyone 
2061 How did it take me so many damn years to watch this?Don Corleone isn‚Äôt afraid to kill a bitch but still goes home to unconditionally love his family. Iconic. 
2062 i only rewatched this in hopes i would remember some stuff so i could watch part two but i forgot that halfway through this movie my brain cells start to fail and i just don‚Äôt understand whats happening especially in the last few scenes and i really sat there watching this movie at 5am absolutely sleep deprived. really hoping my brain cells get themselves together so i can watch part two and understand what‚Äôs going on!!!

2065  The endurance of the film as a cultural monument is not in question. Corleone is a synonym for Mafia tactics and corruption, frequently used to describe repressive and thieving governments. The infamous scene of finding a horse's head in one's bed is a byword for a threat to one's life, likewise the "Sicilian message" of somebody "sleep[ing] with the fishes" if fish are delivered to friends or relatives wrapped in an item of the deceased's clothing.

2075  I haven't seen this in almost 20 years.Family, honor, tradition, la cosa nostra.I'm rating this high because I'm very aware that this is a phenomenal picture. But to be frank, I've never emotionally attached myself to it they way the rest of the civilized world has. That's not an attempt at being a contrarian film bro, but just a matter of fact truth.

2076  I'll rewatch Pt. II in the following days to confirm, but I'm fairly certain that I like Pt.

This was a fun world to immerse myself into, the 1940s New York Italian mob scene. Being introduced to the Corleone family one by one and see everyone involved with them. Every moment of dialogue is killer, every actor nails it to a T. The action was good, good crime scenes, long but enjoyable watch. Was a gross rainy day so I figured today was a great day to watch it.

2085 1st time watching, saw the hype and praise and was ready to call it overrated and overhyped but i was dead wrong. 175 minutes worth of pure cinema, the cinematography, the acting and everything else is just chefs kiss. standout performer for me is tied between al pacino or marlon brando, so many iconic scenes in this film as well it's crazy. if there were an option to give this movie 6 stars i would do it in a heartbeat, period. 11/10.

2093 After watching The Offer I couldn‚Äôt refuse to watch this masterpiece again. Most thrilling movie I‚Äòve ever seen. The 3 hours went by like nothing. There are no flaws. Everything is perfect. The best picture in the history of film and my all time favorite. 
2094  Without a doubt amongst the greatest of all motion pictures. Marlon Brando is Don Corleone in what may be his best performance. The film works on every level and still remains as potent today. The saga of the Corleone family and their rise in the mob world is the quintessential American story. At first it seems as though Vito Corleone is the central character, but it soon becomes clear that young and comparably innocent Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is really‚Ä¶  
2095  Sometimes, a film is so widely loved, so strongly praised, so mythologized, that it is difficult to separate the merits of the movie on its own from its legacy and prestige. And yet, every time I rewatch the The Godfather I am struck by how beautiful this movie is just as a single watching experience. Outside of the trilogy and the references and the influence it had on filmmaking, The Godfather is simply a wonderful movie. Its characters are surprisingly‚Ä¶

2097  "The Godfather". What comes to mind when your hear those words? The greatest film of all time? The best cast ever assembled? One of the biggest achievements put to film? One of the most emotion evoking scores you've heard? The best pacing of any film in cinema? Well, you might not immediately think of those questions, but I certainly do.The Godfather is the film. If there was only one film that's without a doubt perfect, it's The Godfather. When‚Ä¶  
2098 Saw this in my student union theater. The sound was overblown and the quality must‚Äôve been 720p, but it felt like the original version than a remastered or upgraded version.

The only other movie with the same pace that I love is Whiplash, I just really how these movies take their time to tell the story, it doesn't feel forced or too fast 
2103  The most supremely overrated film of all time due to its fundamentally broken plot, focus on character rather than story, extreme overlength without corresponding narrative substance, and content (even when censored). Film entirely lacks a plot and is overrun with multiple pointless storylines full of vague details. Michael's turn (which is the vital core of the plot) is not set up and clearly established at all, making the entire drama contradictory and his character arc illogical. Has multiple significant plot‚Ä¶

2110 ‚ÄúI believe in America‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe HOLD this movie has over me is embarrassing. 
2111 The greatest movie in film history 
2112 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   I had forgotten just how brutal this film was. Especially when Carlo is abusive to Connie. I mean rival crime families gunning each other down is expected in a film about dons, territory, profit, and "loyalty", where the police can be bought, newspapers can be purchased to print a certain point of view, political allies and movie studios (and a bandleader) can be "persuaded" to "do business", and when one family won't work with another on trafficking narcotics, out come‚Ä¶   
2113 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Amazing from start to finish with the acting, visuals, writing and original score. The baptism scene was put together so well and a personal favourite scene in the film  
2114  "That's my family Kay. It's not me." Authoritative corruption deals the final blow turning Michael to crime. His vengeance is two-sided: a familial and personal bout. From the start of his uprising, he's taking it too personal; and perhaps that's what the entire film is getting at. The second it becomes personal, moral consideration is sidelined for utmost power, tied to retribution and pride. The war hero is betrayed by his fellow countrymen, his brothers laugh in his swollen face.‚Ä¶  
2115 Das Blut und das T√∂ten war einfach 300 Mal besser als bei den meisten neuen Filmen! 
2116 On rewatch this is solidified as one of the best movies of all time. Don‚Äôt have much to say that I didn‚Äôt hit in my original review but the movie unfolds itself upon multiple viewings. Luca Brasi putting on a bullet proof vest to the lyrics of a Christmas song singing, ‚Äúfriends that are dear to us‚Äù is beautiful and is an example of how methodical this movie is, yet it feels effortless upon viewing. It‚Äôs hard to compare anything else to it without being sacreligious ¬†or without doing this film a disservice. It‚Äôs a masterpiece. 
2117 it insists upon itself 
2118 Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.  ü§åü§åü§å 
2119 50th anniversary rerelease i was gonna write a long, heartfelt review about the power of cinema and all that but all i can think about it how my dad leaned over to me during the movie and went "there's a poster in the back for a fight with jake la motta!! robert de niro easter egg!" 
2120 truly an underrated underground indie masterpiece. more people should watch this 
2121  A case study in cinematic greatness: the stretch in The Godfather from 1:01:13 to 1:29:33. It‚Äôs the sequence bookended by assassinations. First the failed one on Don Corleone and culminating with Michael‚Äôs killing of Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey.¬†¬†Coppola builds unease from the outset. The almost all-black establishing shot of the hospital, coupled with the ominous notes of Nino Rota‚Äôs score. The empty guard posts and the too quiet atmosphere in the hospital are eerie.

2122  I have just finished watching the 4K of this magnificent work of art. The restoration is nothing short of breathless, absolutely exhilerating.It was like seeing it for the first time - and I've seen it in a theatre. On film!Anyone who tells you the picture is darker in the 4K, or that the black levels are off, or that anything is wrong with this remaster is just yankin' your chain.True, the previous Blu-ray edition did have a‚Ä¶  
2123 Sometimes a movie needs to be experienced in a theater, and this is one of them. There‚Äôs so much about this to praise, but I don‚Äôt think I could even start with that. The Godfather is definitely ¬†a one of a king movie, and this is surely one that needs to be watched. Wow, just wow. 
2124  The Godfather :-Watched the Coppola Restoration edition. It is some of the reasons why I consider this film is the greatest piece of art ever made are it shows the atmosphere of the organized crime world, it's function and the heat and darkness surrounded by it in a rooted and reflection-of-reality manner, it being well defined at the culture it belongs to i.e italian-american and also well defined each and every character. These are the basic that need to‚Ä¶  
2125 Grew on me on rewatch. More likely than not, I'm going to watch Part II for the first time tomorrow. Still can't believe that this was made in 1972. In 1972, they were still using the guillotine as means for capital punishment in France. "You come into my house on the day my daughter is to be married, and you ask me to do murder for money." 
2126 I rewatched in the cinema, it was 3 hours full of greatness, this is my first time going there alone, the whole place was empty except me. GREAT EXPERIENCE. 
2127 yes it‚Äôs as good as people say it is and i‚Äôm so glad i got to see it at the cinema 
2128 Just perfect, I got no other words to describe it 
2129  Watching this in the theater was a dream come true.It's rare where I live to get to see some of cinema's all time classics at the big screen. We barely get re-releases like this so when we do get one I make a priority to go and The Godfather was one I always wanted to watch in a theater and what an experience it was. I've seen it before a couple of times and loved it but something hit‚Ä¶

2131  ‚ÄúOw! My ears.‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah I left it noisy. That way it scares any pain-in-the-ass innocent bystanders away.‚ÄùThe harsh and distinct contrast between light and dark in the shady world of the Corleone family visually shows the fight between good and bad in every mans individual soul. It's a world filled with duality and where people do tough choices. A world with harsh rules, harsh limits and thus harsh lighting applications.¬†The Godfather isn't a movie about a crime family‚Ä¶

2139  The Godfather follows Vito Corleone, Don of the Corleone family, as he passes the mantle to his unwilling son, Michael. The film is a psychological dive into a powerful family and the transformation of the main characters are perfectly encapsulated within the movie. This film has one of those big massive reputations and legacies probably only comparable to maybe Citizen Kane because few films are as legendary and held to as high of a cultural achievement as The Godfather.

2144 100/100The perfect film. A ravishing, often times overwhelming experience. It's everything you want in a high stakes crime film: balancing the elements of violence, politics and romance so, so well. Then there's the acting, then there's the cinematography, then there's the beautiful, beautiful music. I've always appreciated this film but now on my third watch, I think I can finally say I've fallen in love with it.

2148  Ngl, I'm not the biggest fan of the mafia style, it's stopped me from fully connecting with The Sopranos in the past, and left me feeling a bit underwhelmed by Goodfellas. But it wasn't an issue with this film.¬†My attention was grabbed right from the first scene. One of the first things I noticed in the film was how each member of the cast did not seem to be simply mafia archetypal characters. Of course they mostly possess a‚Ä¶  
2149 really thought this movie would be overrated but it‚Äôs actually very well made! normally not the type of movie I gravitate towards but i still admire the excellent performances by pacino and brando. the story was also very interesting and seeing michael‚Äôs character development throughout the movie was amazing. overall a very good movie and definitely not overhyped ! 
2150 The first half was absolutely amazing and I loved it so much. But then the last hour felt like an eternity. Omg I was so bored. 3 hours!?!?!?!?!?¬†Ok don‚Äôt get me wrong, literally every aspect of this movie is amazing. Cinematography, dialogue, acting, plot, etc.Well imo there was some underdeveloped characters but it‚Äôs alright.I honestly don‚Äôt see myself rewatching this ever.I 500000% percent see why this is loved so much but it probably just isn‚Äôt rlly for me.Like I said though, first half was IMPECCABLE!

2153 I watched once back in 8th grade when I had the worst attention span ever and I'm pretty sure I zoned out through most of it. I was gonna rewatch it and then give it the same rating with the review "it insists upon itself". But uh it was pretty great, really thought this would be overhyped but no, it's just that damn good. 
2154 Akhirnya nonton juga The Godfather, padahal nggak ada di watchlist cuma karena nangkring aja di urutan kedua Top 250 imdb jadi tertarik.Dan yahhh, ternyata sangat terkagum terlebih karena Al Pacino yang gantengnya ngga ada obat. HAHAHAHA. Belum lagi karakter yang dimainkan Marlon Brando sang Godfather itu sendiri yang gimana ya aku liat dia berwibawa banget, mengayomi walaupun munculnya ngga banyak. Huhu.Tiga jam yang butuh kesabaran. Karena film mafia ini berjalan lambat, rumit, banyak nama-nama yang muncul dan aku jadi tau apa itu consigliere sebenarnya. Jadi inget Vincenzooooo~

2156 Was f√ºr ein Film! Ein Mafiaepos wie man es bis heute nie wieder gesehen hat. Einer Meiner Ewigen Lieblingsfilme und der beste Coppola Film. 5 Sterne! Sonst kann einem, glaub ich, nicht mehr geholfen werden. 
2157 not even going to try to say anything :) 
2158 I want to have a word with the 384 people who gave this a 1/2 star. 
2159 Capolavoro senza tempo, che riporta in auge il genere gangster, innalzandosi a modello di riferimento per le affini opere successive. Ogni componente filmica risulta visivamente pregevole e funzionale all'epicit√† del racconto, contribuendo a suscitare la giusta dose di tensione. Notevoli in tal senso l'affascinante regia di Coppola, la fotografia ambrata, le musiche di Nino Rota e le magistrali interpretazioni di Al Pacino e Marlon Brando. Un film iconico, che ha segnato per sempre l'immaginario collettivo e la storia del cinema. 
2160  I‚Äôve asked my family for the Blu-ray of THE GODFATHER CODA for Christmas.

2166 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to make him an offer he can‚Äôt refuse,‚Äù¬†Its totally griping from beginning to end but I did have a handful of issues that ruined my immersion. Also that score was just pure perfection.¬†Positives: A great and engaging script that never bored me, good emphasis on making all the characters relevant, good framing composition.But some of the violence and acting didn‚Äôt work for me. The Don‚Äôs daughter was pretty bad and that public scene with Sonnie just wasn‚Äôt convincing.¬†It was all great and I see myself revisiting it, but it didn‚Äôt offer me that escapism I love in film. 
2167 I‚Äôll make him an offer he can‚Äôt refuse. 
2168 First rewatch since high school (completely forgot Vito gets shot early on), and yeah, from the opening moments, you know you‚Äôre watching a masterpiece. Nothing snarky to say. 
2169 It's the Godfather... what the fuck else is there to say? 
2170 What nuance could I bring to this certified classic through my own perspective in a review of this movie?¬†Absolutely none, this film is excellent, watch it right now if you haven‚Äôt.(Also, this movie is incredibly rewatchable, I keep finding more and more things to appreciate about it each time I view it.) 
2171 COVID-19. Self-quarantine movie watch #253.I feel that everything that needs to be said about this movie has already been said. But I'm actually happy that I watched this movie at last.It has an amazing script, the acting of everyone here is superb and I admire the quality and the awesomeness of the work from Al Pacino and Marlon Brando. The cinematography and the score is also something to admire. Even if this type of story is not my taste, it is still a great film. It is also surprising how well this holds over time.

2174 the baptism scene... chills literally chills 
2175  Holy balls of fire. It was hard for me to like the film at first, since I‚Äôve never watched a film like it. I‚Äôve seen Goodfellas, which I consider now to be one of my favorite films ever, and this is nothing like it. Both are great in their own way, but throughout the film I can‚Äôt help comparing them and tell myself that this is inferior. But as the story progresses, I understand why the movie gets all the‚Ä¶  
2176 I‚Äôd say that if a movie is considered to be the best movie of all time than that pretty much means it gets a safe place in my top 5. 
2177 i dunno if you've heard of this little hidden gem, it's pretty indie tbf. but i dont know man, it's pretty decent. more people should really see this, haven't heard anyone talk about it before. 
2178  Before the review, a little bit of context.So, earlier this year I decided to make a list of every feature-length film I watched this year, so I could keep track of what I've been watching! And I wanted my 100th to be special! And what's more special than the film considered by many to be the greatest movie ever made? With a 4.3 score here on Letterboxd, and a 9.1 o IMDb, The Godfather seemed like the perfect film‚Ä¶  
2179 It insists upon itself 
2180  Em todos filmes de m√°fia eu fico confusa com a quantidade de personagens e de conflitos, e depois eu n√£o lembro de quase nada do filme, pois n√£o consigo absorver o conte√∫do, como em Scarface e O Irland√™s, por mais que eu tenha achado ambos filmes bons. E, possuindo esse problema com esse tipo, eu jurava que ia ser mesma coisa com O Poderoso Chef√£o, mas na verdade, eu consegui acompanhar a maior parte do filme e realmente fiquei surpresa‚Ä¶  
2181  Let me preface this review by saying I have seen The Godfather before, which makes my remarks that much more impactful, in my opinion. (Spoilers ahead)Everyone has seen The Godfather. Cinephiles and non-cinephiles alike. Because it‚Äôs a masterpiece. And it is, even for common movie-goers. However, these past couple of years I have gone from a common movie-viewer to a cinephile. This movie solidified that feeling, and I will explain why.¬†I loved this movie the first time I‚Ä¶  
2182 I'm giving it 5 stars because I was given an offer I couldn't refuse 
2183 It‚Äôs The Godfather, what do you want me to say?¬†It's nearly flawless, one of the most iconic and influential films ever made. And just like with classics such as¬†The Good, the Bad and the Ugly or Goodfellas,¬†I didn't find myself all that much invested in it. The film just didn't wow¬†me, like I expected it to. It‚Äôs more of a personal problem though, and I don't have any issues with it from a filmmaking or writing perspective. Mafia films just never resonated with me, and that's fine.¬†Also, Marlon Brando‚Äôs performance in this is one of the best I've ever seen. Legend. 
2184  AFI 100 Greatest Films - #3This one never gets old for me, and I may even gain more respect with each watch. The acting, cinematography, script and plot all blend perfectly, making three hours melt away completely. The number of lines from this film still used in popular culture always astounds me and I have to guess this was my first experience watching an antihero play such a large role, a device which has become all too common today.‚Ä¶  
2185 On the poster it looks like the cat is holding the marionette strings with its little paw 
2186 97/100Definitely one of the best movies ever made, and is possibly the closest movie ever to be a masterpiece. The only con in my opinion is the pacing. The movie is 3 hours long and you can definitely feel that runtime after a while. But besides that, the movie is an absolute masterpiece that everyone should watch at least once. 
2187  If you were anything like me, you saw many movies in your youth‚Äîbut movies were just movies. They weren't a whole lot different than sports or water slides or riding a bike: they were just a fun way to pass the time. When I began to seriously watch movies in my young adulthood, I remember seeing The Godfather. It was one of the first movies I remember watching that was actually profound. I had never considered that the acting, cinematography,‚Ä¶  
2188 A truly iconic piece of cinema and an undeniable masterpiece in every aspect.

2191 Just as poetic as the first time 
2192 Young Al Pacino is hot don't @ me 
2193 I've lost count how many times I've seen this but it never loses its charm. Loyalty, friendship, greed, betrayal, love for the family and vengeance are the key elements of this film. How power corrupts even a good person will do evil things for survival and protecting the family legacy. This epic saga is timeless. I think every human being should see it regardless of preference in movies.This review is a tribute to the one and only man whom I'm forever grateful for his superior taste and love for cinema. I miss you dad. See you in the after life. 
2194 AFI Top 100 Club boxd.it/1cOza#2 - The GodfatherI think that it's just easier to list all the things that I don't like about The Godfather.Here they are. 
2195  There is nothing I can say about this film that hasn't been said already. The screenplay, the performances, Coppola's direction, all outstanding and the score is one of my favourites of all time.¬†The Godfather is a slow film, extremely slow, and for that reason I considered dropping my rating down by half a star.¬†It takes a lot of patience to watch this film, patience that I don't have, but it just didn't sit right with me to take away‚Ä¶  
2196 imagine cheating on Diane Keaton yikes. Michael does alot of terrible things in this series but that's gotta be the worst 
2197 First single-sitting rewatch in more than a decade. The repeat power of THE GODFATHER surprises me. When was the last time you rewatched a three-hour film and found yourself glued to the screen, immobile? Anticipating each scene, yet still experiencing surprise, noting new details, studying the ways that Pacino's Michael Corleone subtly transforms into his father. 
2198 I feel like if I give this anything less than a 4.5 or higher it means I hate it and have to explain myself.It's extraordinarily well crafted and a great movie but it just didn't interest me as much as I wanted it to. 
2199 It's amazing that I haven't written a review on this film on here before. But I guess it's because I figured everyone already knows how I feel about this film considering it is at the top of just about every single one of my top all time lists.For me this movie is absolutely perfect if every aspect casting, acting, writing, cinematography, direction, score...everything. So rather than drag this out into a long review I will just put a 10/10 and be done with it. 
2200 Seventeen-year-old me reluctantly watched this 1,000 years ago and decided right then and there that certain movies can transcend the medium and are not even comparable to anything else because they are that good. The Godfather is perfect and nothing will ever come close to capturing such greatness on film. Except for Suicide Squad or some shit, of course. 
2201 A family film above all else. Gangsters you care about. A film about the Amercian Dream and how it failed Americans.

2203 It has been many years since I watched this in the theater. And honestly, while I remember it being very good, my recent viewing has confirmed that all other films pale in comparison. The story arc, the acting, cinematography, everything is top rate. What an experience! I now must apologize to all other films I have watched, because every other film on my list moves down one notch. Long Live The King! Long Live The Godfather! 
2204 It's not Citizen Kane. 
2205 Still magnificent.One of the best films ever made, and that isn't just empty praise. There is a literate screenplay, excellent performances, and visuals which are simply gorgeous. It doesn't have a bad or a dull moment. Oh, and yes, Brando is superb.

2208  Probably the most Influential movie ever made. This masterpeice is regarded as one of the greatest films of all time for a reason. Marlon Brandos performance alone makes this movie a 10/10, backed up with one of the greatest scores of all time and some of the greatest cinematography youll ever see.

2210 this watch was somehow the first time where i really noticed the prevalence of the esoteric/exoteric distinction via the doorway framing, this best exemplified in the hospital scene where michael quite literally steps back into a completely different mode of being. there's a dimension of hypocrisy that's not easy to understate, but this is also the first viewing where i've noticed the rapid oscillations between states & the tolls that these movements really have (the editing is also rhythmically so well-established in points like the louis scene such that it creates an almost laboured burst of one veil directly into another). 
2211 Rewatching both this and part 2 today 
2212 In the words of Peter Griffin, I did not care for The Godfather 
2213 Der Pate. Ein Film wo mir wirklich die Worte fehlen.Auch wenn ich welche aufsagen k√∂nnte, w√§re es dem Film doch zu wenig. Zu wenig um dieses Meisterwerk, was die Filmgeschichte sowie die Popkultur ma√ügeblich gepr√§gt hat, zu ehren. 
2214 this movie sucked ass 
2215 this movie is so insanely long but good wowthe death scenes were incredible 
2216 Okay FINE. I'll admit, it's a great film. Now leave me alone Vic >:( 
2217 Idk if there's anything more to be said about this film which hasn't been said yet. Minor inconveniences aside, it's an overall solid film with strong performances and simple yet effective soundtrack. 
2218  I cannot tell you how much of a high I was on seeing this in the cinema for the 50th anniversary rerelease. It seems Odeon are doing more of these classic screenings lately and I‚Äôm so happy about it.I remember being super hesitant to sit and watch this for the first time a few years ago. Most of the critically acclaimed classics I had seen before this had been a bit of a let down so I was worried.‚Ä¶  
2219  I had the fantastic opportunity to watch this for my very first time in a theater. Thinking back on it, I don't think I would want to watch it any other way. I often fear watching movies like Star Wars, The Godfather, Apocalypse Now, and many other highly rated classic films because they may not live up to the hype or I may not love them as much as many people do. Well, I can say with confidence that The‚Ä¶  
2220 First time viewing, in a cinema. Happy to report The Godfather is in fact pretty good. Though it takes some time to get going and yet seems to jump ahead abruptly a couple times despite the epic scope. And some of the kills are pretty goofy. But whatever, it's The Godfather, it's better than almost all other movies and packed with iconic sequences. The cat shoulda got more screen time though.

On a fourth watch, its underlying themes of capitalist greed, an immigrants struggle for survival and how that competes with the ideas of the "American Dream", and just how subtly Michael's past as a "war hero" allowed him to cross the threshold into managing the family stuck out for me. What a banger.

2227 There is no doubt that this is a great film. Although I hardly felt any emotion with it, I can't say I wasn't thoroughly impressed and engrossed with the film throughout its runtime. Maybe it went for a little too long and I noticed some poor execution here and there but I mean, it is The Gofather. So I guess it's like a masterpiece or whatever. Anyway it's a really good movie that is definitely one of the best I've seen. 
2228 someone take this movie away from me i cant stop watching it.... 
2229 Simply one of the greatest movies of all time, obviously the story is perfect, the actors and casting are perfect, the directing is flawless. Everything is just phenomenal, I really appreciated all the subtle little details and just the whole film on its own as an experience a lot more second time around and yeah I desperately need to watch part 2. 
2230 (yeah yeah i know it‚Äôs only been like 20 days since I last rewatched this. i would prefer not to talk about it.) 
2231  i somehow lived 24 years of life without watching THE GODFATHER or getting spoiled on anything about it, which means that it took me 45 minutes to realize that THAT was al pacino. forgive me mr pacino. i‚Äôve only seen you in THE IRISHMAN and your energy there was wildly differentanyway, great movie! the first half hooked me and then the second half lost me a bit. this is partially because all these mafia guys look the same to‚Ä¶  
2232  Did not care for The Godfather. People tell me this is a perfect movie, and that it has a great cast. Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall...they are fine actors, but I still did not like the movie. I just couldn't get into it that much. Guess it just didn't gel with me. It insists upon itself. It takes forever getting in, you spend like six and a half hours...I've honestly never gotten through this movie all the way.‚Ä¶  
2233 What a huge film, a true cinema monument, something unique, something special, a gangster film but like no other gangster film, with probably the most amazing cast of history, with probably the most amazing performance of all time in the person of Marlon Brando, with such cult musical themes, and an extraordinaire photography, the majesty itself, here is The Godfather.(edit : bon au final, il faudrait att√©nuer la review : le film ne m‚Äôa pas suffisamment marqu√© pour conserver son excellente note .. ne me frappez pas)8/10.

2236  Watching this on a seemingly ancient double VHS made me appreciate the blu world that we live in. There is much lamenting the state of the world these days, given the death of the video store, cell phones and talking in theatres, and a bunch of other stuff. While all this stuff is lame, the pros of this modern age definitely outweigh the cons. We've got blus that look as good, if not better than the films looked in their‚Ä¶  
2237 I may be the only living person who doesn't like this. I only got 52 minutes in, and all I could see was men asserting their masculinity through violence and power. I have seen this too many times. It was also quite talky and not much seemed to be happening.

It‚Äôs been 51 years and the movie is as fresh as ever. So many memorable lines and scenes, it truly is one of the best movies EVER made.

2256 At this point I have watched this film so many times but still find it to be probably the best film I have ever seen.

Yes this is my top film of all time and I don‚Äôt see anything beating it for a long time, although LOTR is a close second I do love this slightly more.

2279  What can I say about this movie that hasn‚Äôt been said already. When I originally watched it I was younger and was more into Jason Bourne style action movies and the only mob movie I had seen was the departed.

2283  Now where do I beginüò≥ I have been wanting to watch this film for a very long time. I am glad I did.THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be. Just the stories behind makingThe‚Ä¶  
2284 Hard to find a better paced movie that's this long. Intricate rituals and grudges weaved together with moments of sudden violence. There's formality to it all, meeting a Don is akin to meeting the Pope. When there's a hit to be carried out, the seating chart is already arranged. Within the formality, the members themselves are casual. Killing is just another errand. It's this composure amidst death that makes Michael's ascent feel preordained. He's clever and calm when the threat is looming, baptized in the blood he spilt. 
2285  Finally watched this 50 year old film considered one of the greatest ever. It was a pretty entertaining watch with a lot of highlight reel moments, including shocking Mundi face deaths, the restaurant showdown, Sonny beating up bitchass Carlo, and that whole baptism ordeal at the end. What was most intriguing was the moral devolution of Michael Corleone, cinema's It Girl, as he got more involved in the dangerous business of his dancing queen father, Don Vito Corleone. Wonder if‚Ä¶

2288  So many memorable sequences & performances. Al Pacino being at his finest always helps. His seamless transition from a war hero to a mob boss can‚Äôt be overstated.

2302 One of the best cinema experiences I've had was watching The Godfather in 4k. Despite watching this less than a year ago, this rewatch was just as good. It really is the perfect family drama, with every scene being iconic.Also, I still stand by what I say about Al Pacino being robbed by not being nominated for best leading actor instead of supporting.

2320  The Corleone family is not as strong anymore. Marlon Brando plays Vito Corleone, a powerful mafia boss and he's iconic, quietly volcanic in the role. Everything seems unstable. The oldest son Fredo is a soft dumbbell, he can't rule this mafia family. The late Cazale is wonderfully dopey.

It was like meeting your grandfather in person after only speaking to him on the phone your whole life.

2351  Extraordinary!!, With an epic soundtrack, characters, plot, casting, and direction this film has to be considered the best of all time. While this is one of Francis Ford Coppola's many masterpieces, this film is different from the others. By telling Corleone's story from within the family and the mafia, viewers easily identify and care about the character. The cinematography is also excellent, and some of the shots and scenes from this film can be considered the best of any film‚Ä¶

2359 One of those mythical perfect movies that gets mentioned, parodied, and referenced about everywhere you look, The Godfather is a fairly intimidating work of art, given it‚Äôs reputation. And for me, it just about hits the mark. While I was never 100% engaged in the story, the sheer ambition on display is so impressive, and there are some scenes that I will walk away from this movie remembering.Overall, a pretty great classic.

2366  This is one of those 5 star ratings that's just easy to hand out, I already knew I would love it from the opening scene alone, Brando has a screen presence that demands your attention even in the quiet moments. Examining the mob world through the lens of cunning competency and strategy, it's so compelling to see how the Corleone family remains intact in the face of real-world history and the rise of the drug trade. Truly fitting the term‚Ä¶  
2367 I don't know what this means, but Vito Corleone reminds me of my grandfather. He's not a mobster or even Italian but just the way he carries himself and how much he cares about his family. I guess I gotta take some canolies. 
2368 The Goodfather. I love Coppola‚Äôs complete immersion and commitment to the culture. It feels as right as anything ever has. The brooding music just sends chills or invokes feeling. It always does exactly what it needs to. When The Godfather is at its best, it‚Äôs as good as movies ever get. For something so long, I prefer very focused character study (see Scorsese), but would also have to be mad to create faults that aren‚Äôt there. It‚Äôs so fundamental, it demands respect. 
2369 it's about the complete moral corruption of every single one of them (excluding kay) yet you still hate carlo the most and want to see him ripped limb from limb

2378  üèÜ98%The Godfather has always been hailed as a masterpiece and a classic so I had very high expectations going into this. I was not disappointed.The Godfather is one of the most well crafted and one of the best films I have seen and is easily in my top 30 of all time. Francis Ford Coppola crafts a great script. All the characters are very likeable and they are all fleshed out to their fullest. Every performance is great‚Ä¶

2380  "I like Mafia movies."- me, one day ago, after watching GoodfellasSo... some months ago one of my friends with many similar film opinions watched this movie for the first time & really disliked it (his review). But before watching this I never, absolutely never thought that he's actually right. But since I agree with everything that he says in his review I don't really think writing a new one is necessary. I know that I'll probably lose a lot‚Ä¶  
2381 gangster movies are so fucking cool, i mean i had a few problems w the movie but i can get over most of them due to the time of the release one street fight looked really fake with the punches and kicks. but i guess other than that it had great performances, story, cinematography, action, music. i wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs the greatest movie of all time but it holds up a lot obviously. 
2382 Eh, it was good. 
2383  I cooked pasta for dinner then had some limoncello I just brought back from Italy in order to make this a bang-up Godfather viewing cherry-poppin‚Äô experience.¬†The Sicilian scenes put a stupid smile on my face. Italian-speaking Pacino in that hat, yes yes. In all hats for that matter! All Pacino scenes. All scenes! Loved this movie.Spoiler below:¬†And I just gotta say- I went in knowing absolutely nothing, and the most moving and significant part of the journey‚Ä¶

Thanks to Folkets Bio/The People's Cinema in Ume√•, Sweden.Three hours went by very quickly and it never felt too long.The cinematography was incredibly BEAUTIFUL at the big screen.Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are of course excellent, but so are Robert Duvall, in my opinion. This time I also noticed Sterling Hayden and Ricardo Conte more, compared‚Ä¶  
2391 this deserves all the hype tbh 
2392 Took a close friend of mine to see this for her first time tonight at the local indie theater (she'd seen most of it in pieces, but never start to end). An all time favorite for myself and this is the third time I've seen it in a theater setting. It never ceases to hold my attention and I always get something new from each viewing. A Classic. A Legend. A Masterpiece. All appropriate titles but none necessarily captures the essence. This film is lighting in a bottle, sealed and ready for consumption.I love it. 
2393  I often find it difficult to make myself sit down and watch these ultra-popular, universally-acclaimed masterpieces that I haven't seen before, probably because of the impossibly high expectations. So, for my 1,000th feature film, I decided I had to watch the one film that has been on my watchlist the longest.The world of the Corleone family feels extremely authentic thanks to the combination of excellent performances, direction, writing, score and everything else that went into the production. I think‚Ä¶  
2394 These people should be committed to some kind of institution, separated from society where they can't hurt anyone, because they are obviously deranged and dangerous.

2398 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   The Godfather is a flawless coordination and execution of all the elements of film. It is a mastery of form in the most artistic sense. There.I'm Italian. Italians go bananas over The Godfather because it is the ultimate authentic depiction of Italian American culture. Every corner of this film has a detail that rings true. Just in their social interactions: the face touching, argumentativeness, casual drinking routines, even the way everyone plays cards anytime they have a second, all‚Ä¶

Now I think this is a near-perfect portrait of a criminal family - their personal lives, family rituals, and war againt rivals. Great balance between little details and some great moments (even the death of minor characters are memorable). But it's also problematic when it deals with the‚Ä¶

The Godfather Review"I'm gonna make him an offer he won't refuse." - Don CorleoneThis film is nothing short of a masterpiece that will live on forever in the hearts of cinema lovers everywhere and anyone who denies this needs to have their brain tested.

2403 It has been quite some time since my last watch of The Godfather and what can I even say? Even after my 5th watch I'm still just as amazed as I was the very first time I watched it. It geniuenly deserves every last bit of the love, praise and appreciation it gets. It simply is one of the most tremendous and astonishing achievements in the history of cinema. Can't wait to revisit part 2 
2404 i loved the part when michael said ‚Äúnow i am become godfather, destroyer of families‚Äù 
2405 the baptism scene...the music, the sequence, pacino's performance. oh, cinema reached a new peak, fr. happy 52 years of the godfather for those who celebrate. ü§ç 
2406  To the people who say that Bheeshma Parvam was a copy of The Godfather, kind of a vague comparison isn't it?After watching many crime dramas about Italian organized crime families and playing games like Mafia 1, It's an amazing experience to watch for the first time the movie that inspired them all. A milestone in the gangster genre and one that is so influential that even a member from the infamous Gambino crime family was apparently overcome with joy.‚Ä¶  
2407  goddamn! i feel like i‚Äôve just watched this for the first time. again, the same situation with goodfellas, i gave this four stars when i first watched it because i thought it was boring but beautifully shot. i was so fucking ignorant!¬†the character of michael is absolutely stunning! pacino is a master of his craft in this, no wonder this was the main film that made him blow up into stardom. caan is also incredible, he has to be‚Ä¶  
2408 I had to rewatch before I see the sequel, I‚Äôd forgotten what made this movie so great which is, basically everything. I, like everyone else, could write a big long essay on The Godfather, its influence and every aspect of its creation, but I don‚Äôt have anything new to say so I won‚Äôt bother. Every single aspect of this movie is incredible, the story is an incredible thrill, the characters are phenomenal, just everything about the movie is perfect. An essential watch for sure, one of the greatest films of all time, may be the movie with the highest quality. 
2409  Finally got around to watching this and it's soooo long but it is so worth it. I mean it's THE GODFATHER it's perfect I mean there's scenes in here I could go on and on about it truly is a masterpiece of a film! Especially that scene between Michael and Apollonia when she wears the necklace like come onü§≠ But the real reason why this film is so amazing is down to AL PACINO he's so so so hot and‚Ä¶  
2410  The best mob film I‚Äôve seen so far!The Godfather is not one of the GREATEST films of all time. At least in my opinion. But, it‚Äôs a damn good one! The film shows the fascinating mob life, through family, betrayal, friendship, and murder. Through all of it, I was able to find what makes this film great.For me, I personally enjoyed getting to see the iconic bits for the first time, such as the horse‚Äôs head and Vito‚Äôs‚Ä¶  
2411  My thoughts on The Godfather (Rewatch)‚Ä¶The story is the definition of immaculate and immersive when it comes to mob drama‚Äôs, each sequence utilised to its furthest extent to apply significance to either the story or character development. The godfather‚Äôs story manages to capture each emotion fantastically whether it‚Äôs a tense dispute/ discussion or whether it be a family gathering filled with enjoyment and affection which assists in fleshing out the majority of characters, especially Michael Corleone. I adored the‚Ä¶

2413  Tonight my wife Robin said "It's still pretty early. You wanna watch THE GODFATHER? I've never seen it." "It's happening‚Ä¶" I thought. I'm not even an obsessive fan of the film. I mean, one cannot argue with its iconography, and even that term is too small for what this movie has become. I think I actually prefer the sequel, or at least I think that until I'm watching this and am reminded of how seamlessly this is all woven together.‚Ä¶  
2414 I‚Äôm so BORED 
2415  watching at 26 in an eternal pandemic as cinema (both industrially and creatively) hobbles, and this was simultaneously an untouchable tome and, for the first time, a studio picture by some 31 year old guy. it might be the cynicism, it might be the whole learning more as i get older thing, but rewatching THE GODFATHER in spaced out junctures of my life has proven that it's evolving and aging with me more dramatically than any other piece of art.‚Ä¶  
2416 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   It's been 50 years since its release, and I think this is the most referenced movie I've ever seen. Even without thinking about the references, the iconic moments of this film stand solidly on their feet, such was its impact in 1972 that today no one can hear the phrases "an offer you won't be able to refuse", "look how they butchered my boy" or even hear a mention of the Sicilian mafia without thinking of this film.

2422  "I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."This is not a joke, I have not seen The Godfather until now. Mainly because I've been so intimidated by it, and that intimidation reared its ugly head again when I struggled for 10 minutes to pick a quote for this review. Ok onto the movie, what did I think, well no fucking shit, I loved it! I think there's no better place to start than with the film's best aspect,‚Ä¶  
2423  Big Don Barzini energy.¬†Coppola‚Äôs world building here rivals that of even the great Joss Whedon. He‚Äôs almost as good with actors as Zack Snyder too. All kidding aside, this film is so deeply, intractably entrenched in pop culture, it can tend to become an exercise in checking off reference boxes when one watches it. Each character and scene deservedly ensconced and deified. A film with moments so iconic and well known, it almost feels as if the very notion‚Ä¶  
2424 50th Anniversary Trilogy 4K Ultra HD Version. Oh boy does it look beautiful. The introduction from Coppola deserves 5 stars on its own. There are some films that will stand the test of time no matter how old they become.This is one of those films. 
2425 When Tom Hagen sheds a single tear for his adoptive father that he believes to be dead, is the moment I realized how interconnected each character is in this film. Brilliant cinema in every way! I was so happy that Julia invited me to see this in the theaters with her! 
2426 My god, seeing this in a theatre (still kinda surreal that I just did) enhanced my appreciation of this even more.It's an insane epic and truly one of the all time greats, deserving every ounce of its awesome reputation.Also, seeing The Batman tomorrow and most likely doing a Kingsman marathon while drunk with a friend on Saturday.

2431 Es una obra maestra, poco m√°s puedo decir que no se haya dicho ya.Todos hablan de la enorme actuaci√≥n de Marlon Brando (merecido obviamente), pero en mi opini√≥n, Al Pacino es el mejor personaje de la pel√≠cula.Cuando ha acabado, ni me hab√≠a dado cuenta de lo r√°pido que hab√≠an pasado las 3 horas, de las que no sobran ni 5 minutos.

The narrative is smooth and brutal and clean, and it is still incredibly modern, with the beautifully sinister Gordon Willis cinematography, which captures the action is all its golden darkness.

As for present me, I now want to inject gangster movies into my veins.Scav Hunt #58 | 15/31 | Task #11: Watch a movie composed by, directed by or featuring someone in or who has ever been married into the Coppola family

2439  Film #22 of my February 2016 Scavenger HuntTask #16: A hugely influential trilogy with all 3 gaining Oscar nominations and wins (#1)letterboxd.com/martinjacob49/list/the-movie-kings-february-2016-scavenger-hunt/I think I've found it; The Godfather, the greatest movie of all-time. Everything about is filmmaking at its highest peak. Top-notch direction, stunning cinematography, phenomenal music, the best cast ever in a movie (with James Caan, Al Pacino, Abe Vigoda, Robert Duvall, and of course, Marlon Brando), and tells the most complex story involving gangsters ever,‚Ä¶  
2440  Film #20 of Driver‚Äôs December Project Dos: ‚ÄòThis is the End, Beautiful Friend'"My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator." - Michael CorleoneHow does one rationally explain that they don't fully appreciate the 'divine' majesty of Francis Ford Coppola's cinematic yardstick that many millions undoubtedly call the 'greatest film ever made'? The answer? One can't. I don't think that there's anything particularly 'wrong' with it per se, but‚Ä¶  
2441  Well, it's been a long time coming, but I've finally watched the masterpiece hailed as the greatest film ever made. Yeah. I dig that statement. It could be just that.Since this is a very much belated first watch, though, there's still plenty under the surface I haven't uncovered. Whilst astounded by The Godfather being both a simultaneously sprawling, wide epic and a focused character study, I somehow couldn't find myself getting completely into it. But I'm sure on a‚Ä¶  
2442 So. Iconic.¬†So. Perfect.¬†I sat my little brother down and explained the entire fucking plot to him, poor boy.¬†So insanely quotable‚Ä¶ quite possibly the greatest film ever made? Not my favourite but fuck it deserves that‚Äôs title

2445  "Only don't tell me that you're innocent. Because it insults my intelligence ... and it makes me very angry."Watching 'The Godfather' again has been quite an emotional ride. It's amazing how this movie keeps surprising me every time I see it. The storytelling and characters are so rich that with each viewing, I feel more connected to them. The term 'masterpiece' perfectly fits this film. It's like your favorite song that always hits you right in the feels, no‚Ä¶  
2446 Christmas Day. Our visiting family left around 4 p.m. I closed the curtains, took an edible, and ate eggplant parmigiana while watching The Godfather. Drinking cold limoncello with Apollonia. Lazing. Petting a cat. Loving life.merry xmas. salud. 
2447 The wedding sequence is perfect cinema 
2448 Finally I managed to watch this. And it was everything, everyone always promised me it would be.My Untouchables 
2449  Today I fully completed The Godfather game. When you finish it, they give you the title, 'Don of New York City'. I will now only be answering to that name. The game really got me wanting to watch this again, specifically the first one as a big part of it is the five families of New York (an element that its sequels woefully forgot about). I used to think that The Godfather was probably the best mob movie out there,‚Ä¶

2451 my little meow meows 
2452  Over the course of damn near three hours, The Godfather does a very strange thing; it makes you feel sympathetic to the plight of men whose stock and trade is corruption and murder.One of the ways this is done is by not showing any victims of the Corleone family. We aren't privy to anyone drinking their lives away off of their booze or anything like that. From the film's perspective all the victims get what's coming to them; either‚Ä¶  
2453  This a goddamn masterpiece.First time watching this piece of art.

2459 i don‚Äôt know why it took me so long to watch this masterpiece 
2460 confesso que os primeiros quarenta minutos n√£o foram t√£o agrad√°veis para mim ‚Äì talvez pela lentid√£o. s√≥ que a partir dos minutos seguintes, come√ßa a ficar super envolvente. h√° muito tempo eu n√£o ficava triste com a morte de personagens como fiquei nesse filme. foi uma sensa√ß√£o estranha e ao mesmo tempo interessante ‚Äì como surgiu isso em mim? al pacino se mostrou um excelente ator. a cena do batismo foi uma das minhas favoritas! 
2461  Me ha gustado m√°s y creo que cuando m√°s la vea, m√°s me gustara, pero a d√≠a de hoy, para ser considerada por muchos la mejor pelicula de la historia, a mi no me termina de fascinar del todo. A√∫n as√≠ he de decir que es muy buena eh, banda sonora, actuaciones con marlon brando y al pacino que lo petan, sobre todo brando, que es la que m√°s me gusta de toda la peli, de las mejores actuaciones de‚Ä¶  
2462 how does it get better every timefrom the first shot to the last always captivating.¬†opulent. 
2463 Exhausting fuckin plane rideThere's some serious succession influences in here. Never noticed it, but some characters really relate. Don't spoil the past two episodes for me though I didn't get hbo in KoreaI love this movie, there's so many wonderful aspects, but I've gotta say, there are really so many flaws with this movie. I think that the goods really outweigh the bad for most people, because the way the story moves along is really clunky. 
2464 Touched this time through by the softness of Pacino‚Äôs performance in the first act, and the ways that hardens into a correlating grim restraint. More films should cross-cut between baptisms and massacres. 
2465  Usually I would write a long-ass essay to explain why a movie this important is such a milestone for the media of cinema, but is it really necessary with The Godfather?. Everyone, from casuals movie enjoyers, to dedicated movie guys and critics will tell you this is one of the greatest pieces of cinema ever made, and they'd be right. Every single performance is iconic, every single interpersonal relationship between family members is presented and explored in a compelling way,‚Ä¶  
2466 Al Pacino was so goddam fine

2470  Scuffed watching, i only saw the second half, but. Holy shit.My fraternity has a yearly event based on The Godfather which was this day, and while I should have been doing work‚Ä¶ how am I gonna do stupid spanish homework when people are watching The Godfather in the upstairs TV room???? I got a tiny bit of work done during it at least‚Äîbut by the baptism scene‚Ä¶¬†I finished the last 45 min or so uninterrupted, and.. holy fucking‚Ä¶  
2471 Kevin Hart wasn‚Äôt even in it 
2472 It may insist upon itself, but I still love this classic. Even if it‚Äôs sequel is superior in every way, but more on that later. 
2473 OH MY GOD!!!Im out of words‚Ä¶I am numb.Woah..REALLY THE HOLY BIBLE OF CINEMA. 
2474 Lo admito, si es cine. Y me gusta m√°s porque eliminaron todas las cosas innecesarias que tiene el libro. Es todo lo que yo quer√≠a que fuera y m√°s. 
2475  I can‚Äôt believe I hadn‚Äôt seen this so I finally took the time and watched it and boy I was glad I did. An absolute masterpiece!The Godfather is like Goodfellas where they aren‚Äôt just perfect mobster movies, they‚Äôre perfect movies. Every element of this movie is masterful from some of the greatest performances put to film from the great Marlon Brando, aswell as Robert Duvall, James Caan and Al Pacino who are all just as good. The plot is‚Ä¶  
2476  The Godfather, on 35mm film, in Tarantino‚Äôs New Beverly Cinema, with a sold out crowd, is an offer you just can‚Äôt refuse.¬†Every aspect of this movie is iconic. This was only my second time seeing the film but I feel like I have been surrounded by it my whole life. From the quotes to the scenes to the backstory, it feels like every piece of media tries to steal from it. It‚Äôs insane how blatant it can be. For‚Ä¶  
2477 i‚Äôve been blessed for three hours by michael corleone 
2478 it insists upon itself 
2479 Watch this film in its 4K restauration in cinema! Looked fantastic! 
2480 This took me wayyy too long to get around to watching. This is definitely the best movie I‚Äôve ever seen, literally perfect. 
2481 got a chance to see this at the regal cinemas and what stood out to be was how distinct everyone‚Äôe face is. pacino‚Äôs eyes darken and his body language gets more stiff ad the minutes clock in and as the corleone family becomes as hunted as an endangered species.¬†‚Äúyou think could fool a corleone?‚Äù 
2482 such a timeless masterpiece of classic cinema. if only i could, i'd give it 10 stars :> 
2483 What can I say, it lived up to all expectations and then some. Can I call it the best of all time, I'll sleep on it, but sure why not. I can already see myself rewatching it on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.The Corleones are simply the coldest men in fiction. 
2484 After years of being the only person in my family not to watch this movie,here we are finally...yeah it's pretty great. End of the review 
2485 Meh 
2486 KINO !For a film this rich and complex, the pacing is insane. It just kind of flows from one scene to another even though it's 3 hours long.Peak cinema. 
2487 I especially liked when al Pacino said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve gaba-ed your last gool, governor cuomo‚Äù 
2488 eu tava com as expectativas bem altas por conta de todo o hype desse filme ser um cl√°ssico do cinema, agora que assisti entendo toda a aclama√ß√£o. o marlon brando e o al pacino deram o nome aqui, que show de atua√ß√£o, n√£o d√° pra imaginar ningu√©m interpretando os¬†personagens sem ser eles.e o desenrolar do filme √© muito bom, teve cenas que eu fiquei de boca aberta assistindo (men√ß√£o honrosa a cena do batismo e a cena do carro). enfim, √© um √≥timo filme. 
2489 I feel like my punishment for not particularly enjoying this is that i have to be the first person on my friends list to rate it lower than 4 stars.¬†And that fact genuinely makes me cringe at myself a little. 
2490  This is I think my 3rd view of the film. It's really hard to not call it THE greatest movie of all time.This movie just changes the meaning of cinema. Every second of this movie is perfection, everything contributes to something, nothing is wasted. Every aspect of the film is perfection. I don't even know what the best aspect of this film is? The acting, the screenplay, the direction, the music, the writing? Each and every scene in the‚Ä¶  
2491  Full disclosure - I'm pretty tanked on a whiskey cocktail by this point. We brought back a few bottles of Amaretto from Italy which we're still working our way through. Turns out adding Amaretto to whiskey is a cocktail called "The Godfather", and that was all the excuse I needed!  The urge to wax poetic about this film is hard to fight. It's genius. It's an utter classic. It's consistently rated amongst the contenders for the best film ever made.‚Ä¶  
2492 surprisingly, a great hangover movie 
2493 a local theatre played the remastered 4K version and it‚Äôs beautiful on the screen, but this is one those classic movie everyone talks about that truly does deserve the hype 
2494 contrary to popular belief, i don't, in fact, have an empty void in my thoughts. it's actually just marlon brando playing with the stray kitten he found on the set of the godfather and decided to insert it into the beginning of the movie. that's all there is to it. 
2495 - The Coppola Restoration - Absolutely not one of the best movies of all time. I actually had to watch it in three separate parts because I kept coming close to drifting-off to sleep. Its very well made and is a fantastic film, but it's not a masterpiece in my eyes.That said, there are some perfectly executed scenes. The scene in the diner literally couldn't be better! 
2496 just dudes being dudes 
2497 70s al pacino please make me an offer i can‚Äôt refuse 
2498  14th re-watch ever since I first saw it, and yeah it never ceases to amaze me.I have grown older, recognised movies, mildly understood moviemaking and I am still in awe at the film.I notice little moments - Michael's panic for a split second when he couldn't find the gun at the cistern, the little Oscar statue beside Woltz's bed, the little moments of affection between Caan's Sonny and Pacino's Michael even in the limited interactions they have. It‚Ä¶  
2499 When people talk about their love for cinema, and filmmaking in general, if they don‚Äôt put The Godfather¬†into the conversation as one of the very best films ever made, then it‚Äôs not love.¬†Still, after 50 years, Francis Ford Coppola‚Äôs film is the envy of every film that came after it. 
2500 Hadn‚Äôt seen this in probably six years and yet I still had something like fifteen individual scenes distinctly etched in my memory. Big screen viewing was fun. Don‚Äôt think anyone really has anything novel to say about The Godfather these days‚Äîit‚Äôs multi-faceted Greatness is obvious‚Äîbut I have to note that my feelings toward it remain more like respectful veneration than passionate elation, admiration rather than love, and I‚Äôm not quite sure why.

2502 Drei Stunden die wie im Fluge vergehen. Allein was hier darstellerisch, inszenatorisch und atmosph√§risch aufgefahren wird, ist einfach oberste G√ºteklasse. Ein Epos f√ºr die Ewigkeit! 
2503 The 4K trilogy restoration just came in, I‚Äôm so hyped to rewatch these legendary films in beautiful restoration. 
2504 Every scene is just so iconic that after one happens I‚Äôm always surprised when we still have like 40 more all time iconic scenes remaining.¬†Tom Hagen is really the key to this movie. 
2505 Really good! ¬†Id like it more if I actually followed all the names of the families. Great watch would recommend. 
2506  I was bound to rank this lower than most, yet I still enjoyed it, even though I fell asleep twice watching it.¬†The Godfather is a very good film, it's just not unreal or never before seen.The dialogue was tremendous, the score was great, Marlon Brando is the most iconic lead act of all time, Al Pacino finished off the film with a good 3rd act and the plot overall was great.I expected the cinematography to be subpar, however‚Ä¶  
2507  DO NOT WATCH.Over the course of this movie‚Äôs 3 HOUR¬†runtime, nothing happens. I mean, can anyone who actually liked The Godfather¬†name a single thing that happened in the entire movie? (This is a rhetorical question. If you can name something, please consider getting a life). The only thing I remembered from watching this was that the main mafia guy is Italian. On top of that, this movie is so overhyped that literally everyone who watches it will be disappointed.‚Ä¶

2529 This viewing of The Godfather¬†made me cry at unexpected moments and I don‚Äôt want to TALK ABOUT IT 
2530 Fucking hell, i forgot how good this was. Micheal Corleone is such a cold hearted bastard probably one of my favorite characters OAT 
2531 This film deserves all the recognition it gets, it is simply a before and after in cinema. 
2532 don corleone give me justice 
2533 El Padrino defini√≥ por completo el subg√©nero de los gangsters en el cine. Las que antes eran pel√≠culas baratas ahora pasaron a ser grandes obras llenas de tragedia, problemas familiares y dem√°s. Para m√≠ es una absoluta belleza, a pesar de no ser la mejor de la trilog√≠a. Es dif√≠cil decir algo sobre esta pel√≠cula que no se haya dicho antes. Desde la m√∫sica de Nino Rota hasta las actuaciones y la direcci√≥n de Coppola, The Godfather es una de esas cintas que nunca vas a olvidar.Algo si les recomiendo: leer la novela de Mario Puzzo. Ambas obras se complementan genial. 
2534 Collateral damage of doing film studies is having the baptism scene spoiled at least once a year, thought it might ruin the film but I still enjoyed it. So iconic. 
2535 *italian gangster noise* 
2536 MORE LIKE THE FLOPFATHER 
2537 "The Godfather ¬†is an indisputable masterpiece of cinema. Marlon Brando's performance is just incredible as are the three Corleon brothers: James Cann and Robert Dunvall and Al Pacino who are just excellent in their roles. Francis Ford Coppola directs Mario Puzo's novel in a wonderful way using many metaphors like "üçä" or even "The Nightmare of Johann Heinrich F√ºssli". The music is just iconic and everyone who hears this music thinks Italy üáÆüáπ. ¬´ üçäüçäüçäüáÆüáπüáÆüáπüáÆüáπ‚Äú¬† 
2538 michael corleone and kendall roy would be best friends if they were in the same universe #patheticmen 
2539 I'm so glad I've finally gotten around to watching this and luckily I think it lives up to its hype. The length didn't bother me at all and the pacing worked so well for establishing all the characters and their arcs/motives. It was also fun seeing all the iconic lines in context. I don't really see how Marlon Brando is the lead actor in this though like it's definitely Al Pacino but whatever. The parallels between father and son work so well and what a journey of Michael Corleone. Great, good, excellent. 
2540 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  From a 3.5 to a 5 on rewatch. I low-key am embarrassed for that previous rating.What more to say? I was engrossed for the full 3 hours and watching the rise of Michael Corleone was amazing to see. I still see Al Pacino as a far better actor than Marlon Brando, a disgrace that he was nominated for supporting actor when he's the main man for the entire film almost.Not much more to say after that. Going to rewatch Part 2 soon and then maybe watch Part 3, despite all the controversy.  
2541 Even the way they sit in chairs is epic. 
2542 o al pacino novinho ainda de cara com isso.nao √© atoa que esse √© considerado um dos maiores atos do cinema mundial, o filme √© simplesmente genial em tudo que prop√µe, em todos os seus atos. desde de dire√ß√£o, at√© as atua√ß√µes.a fotografia impec√°vel, fiquei de cara que o filme √© de 70 e a qualidade ja era daquele jeito. 
2543 it‚Äôs just a bunch of italian people talking to each other 
2544 I just wanna kiss the script, marry it. Marlon Brando looks like a bulldog 
2545 I don't think I need to explain this one. Just, the godfather, I finally watched it. Holy fuck. I could explain why it's good, on how it's a actually important film for italian culture, how well it shows the struggles of mafia life, amazing story telling techniques, but do I have to?? Nah, not really. Also how did I not know the line "Look how they massacred my boy" came from this.

2548  It‚Äôs all down to the moment Tom tells Don Corleone who killed Sollozzo and McCluskey. The dream of respectability snatched away from his family, vanished while Vito wasn‚Äôt looking. It was a ridiculous dream for him to have, but something in the filmmaking manages to make this moment feel eminently tragic. It‚Äôs just such an impressive collection of talents and artistic touches. I notice more and more every time, and that‚Äôs what I love about the experience, every time. Still‚Ä¶

2554 this is the greatest christmas movie 
2555 this movie turns me on I‚Äôll just say it 
2556 That Nino Rota score is too gorgeous to describe, and I feel that description goes for the rest of this film in all of its elements too. Just pure brilliance, and I sure as hell know I'm not the first to say that. Very easy to see why many people consider this one of the greatest films of all time, it really doesn't age at all (it obviously does in the literal sense, but it's impact will never change for what I can tell).Onto Part 2! 
2557 those last twenty minutes, oh my god

Mike : *shoots Sollozzo and McCluskey and then ran away*Borat, offscreen : "Great success"Tell that bro Francis Ford Coppola that he did a great fucking job.Kinda glad that I finally watch this after so many recommendations, the reason why I finally did it because I need to watch "The Godfather Part II" so I could finish my task to watch David Fincher's favorite movies that im trying to do rn.

2561 yeah... this was a masterpiece as expected!also im gonna argue with yall film bros, this movie, if not for al pacino and james caan alone, is for the girls and gays! 
2562 Pacino can stare me down like that anyday ;) 
2563 francis bro... just say you hate women and go.

2566 at last, i saw one of the highest rated movies on letterboxd. it was pretty good. i have to say, it‚Äôs not my favorite mob movie that i‚Äôve seen, but i understand why many say it‚Äôs the best. it‚Äôs literally straight mafia. that‚Äôs it, so if you don‚Äôt want the mob then sorry pal. the characters here were pretty interesting, though i thought they were mostly assholes. yet, even that makes sense for this film. the runtime didn‚Äôt feel too draining for a three hour movies, so props to it. it‚Äôs pretty good. 
2567 tag yourself im don corleone's hair getting messier as the movie progresses 
2568 I could've gone for another hour of this so im hyped for part 2. This whole movie gets better as it goes on as does Brando and Pacino's performances. Obviously I'm not saying anything new here but yeah man its masterfully done.Song for the movie: youtu.be/ANMcqkLEKmk 
2569 Majestic and totally stupid, what Kael took as evidence of cinematic alchemy transcending the literary appeared on this viewing tired dissonance

2571 This movie gave me the same anxiety that I experienced watching Uncut Gems. At least several times! 
2572 The MovieI think this is my third time watching this but it feels like my first because the first two times I didn‚Äôt pay proper attention and wasn‚Äôt as educated film-wise, so I‚Äôll just say this...I get it now.Favorite Quote:You‚Äôre taking this very personal. Tom, this is business and this man is taking it very, very personal. 
2573 Diane Keatons eyebrows in this are both my favourite and least favourite aspect of the film 
2574 young al pacino looks like young ray romano and old ray romano at the same time 
2575 Notes from my brother‚Äôs first watch¬†- Right out the gate, my dad walks in and SPOILS half the movie (‚ÄúMan, it‚Äôs sad when Sonny dies. Then, Michael‚Äôs gotta take over.‚Äù)- *Marlon Brando‚Äôs first appearance* ‚ÄúDoes he sound like that the entire movie? And why does his face look so DUMB?‚Äù- ‚ÄúIs this movie supposed to be GOOD yet?‚Äù- *Talia Shire gets beat up* ‚ÄúHehe‚Äù- ‚ÄúThis is just the same thing as The Irishman. But WORSE.‚Äù- ‚ÄúWas I supposed to think that [baptism scene] was COOL?‚Äù- ‚ÄúThat ending was so STUPID. Movie‚Äôs a 6/10 if I‚Äôm feeling generous.‚Äù 
2576 Okay so I watched this growing up as a kid and didn‚Äôt really understand it or take it seriously because well, I wasn‚Äôt old enough. But I‚Äôm classing this as a first watch now and it really is the most complete film that I‚Äôve ever seen. Everything is perfect, the acting, the characters, the script, the score... I could go on and on. There‚Äôs not a scene that‚Äôs wasted or a line of dialogue that doesn‚Äôt belong, everything‚Äôs there for a reason and it all just works so wonderfully. I need to finish this trilogy asap because I‚Äôve been missing out on these films. 
2577  How am I supposed to word this? I hate to say this, but I just couldn't resonate with this movie as much as many others could. It was an absolutely great movie, no doubt about that. But to me, I cannot see this as being one of my favourites of all time. I feel disappointed somewhat because I feel like I'm not supposed to be feeling this way, but I guess it is what it is.My relationship with this‚Ä¶

2579 This film feels like a finished painting. Through the time that it takes to create it, it takes many different forms and once it's finished you sit back in awe at its beauty. The perfection of the filmmaking, the imperfections of the characters, all of it culminates into something known widely across generations as the greatest film of all time. 
2580 Just finished watching this for the first time... Some people say it‚Äôs boring, some people say it‚Äôs one of, if not the greatest film of all time. Maybe it‚Äôs the fact that I‚Äôve rekindled my love for gangster and crime movies recently, or maybe it‚Äôs the fact that I‚Äôve learned how to appreciate films for what they are, either way, The Godfather is a masterclass of a film that deserves every ounce of praise it receives and has received from critics, and cinephiles alike throughout the years. I love Scorsese‚Äôs films, but The Godfather might just be the best damn gangster movie in existence! 
2581 fun fact michael corleone can get it any time any day of the week god bles 
2582 Log no. 1,000Pretty damn good imo 
2583 The climax with the baptism intercut with the five-families all getting whacked, is still just about the most satisfying thing ever. Michael‚Äôs first real test as Don, and just knockin‚Äô it outta the park. Goddamn, Pacino is amazing. 
2584  OkokAfter this watch, I only really have one flaw with this film, and it‚Äôs that I think we spend too much screen time with Micheal in Sicily, I think it kind of messes with the pacingThe rest of this movie is a masterpiece, just the story, already makes this one of the greatest of all time, just the story, the script is really that tight, and well written, but it succeeds in every other aspect as well.

2585 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Perfect movie to drink a nice single malt, sit back in a leather armchair, smoke a cigar and feel properly old to. Don Corleone's death is un-ironically my favorite scene in this.  
2586 perfection. i don‚Äôt know what to say. the score and the lightning were flawless. Brando and Al Pacino gave an unforgettable performance. and that ending!! 
2587  "I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."When talking about The Godfather, it's hard to say something that hasn't already been said before. It's generally considered the best film ever made, and to be honest it isn't far off. It's deserving of that honour, placing and adoration. This is arguably the movie that defines the genre. It really is masterful on every single level, from the direction, to the characters, to the music, to the photography, to the‚Ä¶  
2588 The actions portrayed in this movie, more than perhaps any other crime drama, often feel warranted and this with the setting and beautiful shooting of the film culminate into a masterfully told story that though one can not condone, one can understand. 
2589 Everything in here is flawlessly crafted and works perfectly. If you don‚Äôt love this film, you probably don‚Äôt love film. 
2590  Uff, no la recordaba tan buena. Me imagino que con los a√±os que pasaron ya pude disfrutarla en su m√°ximo esplendor. La direcci√≥n es un deleite visual, la manera en la que compone escenas y momentos es sensacional. Marlon Brando y Al Pacino est√°n espl√©ndidos. Personajes excelentemente escritos, con sus matices, sus trasfondos y exploraci√≥n satisfactoria. Una narrativa lenta que va manejando diversas tem√°ticas que al final obtienen una catarsis, adem√°s de que brinda un cambio a sus personajes. Exposici√≥n‚Ä¶

2593  The Godfather is regarded as one of the greatest films of all time. Of all time. Of. All. Time. To have an accolade such as that isn't just impressive, it's near impossible (especially by today's standards). The consequences of acquiring such an achievement results in expectations being sky high, not just for first time watches but for multiple viewings as well. For me, it's a first time watch...the ultimate question is: Is this really the greatest film ever made? I‚Ä¶

2595 Since the last time I had watched The Godfather, I've watched hundreds of great films, and my views on cinema have radically changed, so I was very curious to know whether I would still find the film as extraordinary as I did years ago; and the answer is yes. This film is simply THE perfect drama film. 
2596 What could a review from me today possibly add to this film's legacy. Nothing. So I'll just kiss the ring instead.Let's just say there's a reason it's a meme when a person doesn't like 'The Godfather'. 
2597  I have such a vivid memory of when I first watched the godfather, I was 11 years old and in year 6 at school. It was our last day of the school year and our teacher literally just said 'fuck it' and put it on for us.I was well and truly blown away by this movie and I truly believe it's what kickstarted my love of film. It's absolutey incredible and although I was much to young to be‚Ä¶

It's 4 AM but I don't care.When people say or list "the greatest films of all time", you'll most likely have some usual choices, some that you almost certainly know is gonna be on it. Your Shawshank Redemption, your Pulp Fiction and whatnot.You hear and you hear about how great these movies are, how everyone must see them, how this is cinematic art at its most pure, and you start‚Ä¶

2603  One of the most interesting aspects of The Godfather -- whose mammoth reputation threatens to swallow whole a work that is still compelling, alive and occasionally troubling -- is its stylistic positioning as a classical work in a modern cinematic landscape. Its nostalgic auburn hues, novelistic scope and stately compositions must have felt nearly old-fashioned in a time of "easy riders and raging bulls." This anachronistic elegance is of course the same as the Corleones'. The family sits in their‚Ä¶

It's a real bitch.The Godfather is often considered the greatest film ever made. 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. #2 on the IMDb Top 250, it actually is tied for #1 as of now, but still...#2.

Is an explanation from myself truly warranted when this film has been praised and analyzed as the crowning jewel of Hollywood for over 50 years now?

I will say that it impresses me a great deal how many people (especially those who are younger and enjoy modern cinema‚Ä¶

2629  Rant Alert.I finally watched this (in theaters) and I am pleased to say that it did not live to the absurd amount of praise (not shared by me, even before watching it). It's a movie alright, not the quintessential most perfect movie ever made by any means.It was boring and (as expected) very fucking overrated. I can't understand what's so great about it, I tried. Not the cinematography, story, characters, genre, nothing stands out in my opinion.Most‚Ä¶  
2630  It never fails to surprise me how great films, when shown in a full cinema, can hold an audience in the palm of their hand. The gasps, laughs (there are some I swear) and moments of acute silence that this film generates, on its 50th Anniversary - drove home for me what expertly crafted storytelling can do.The directing choices are so bold. The camera is so often in close-ups and with barely any lighting. Did Coppola know the magnitude‚Ä¶  
2631 Now this, this is perfection 
2632 1260 movies later, I watched the Godfather! 
2633  I really wanted to give it a higher rating, because I understand that it is a technically well done film, very well directed, with great performances, with memorable lines and scenes (my favorite was the baptism scene, but the opening is also great, I like how the light is used in that scene). But anyway, for my personal taste, it's not the kind of story I like. I also expected it to be more dynamic, the duration makes it tiring.‚Ä¶  
2634 Fuck it I love this movie¬†Ik I clown on this movie a lot, but I saw it again for the first time in like 5 months with my friend (who just got into films recently). And Jesus is this one good. Also comparing this movie to Goodfellas is a big no no. Michael Corleone has some of the greatest character developments I‚Äôve ever seen in cinema.¬†If I can sum this movie up it‚Äôs¬†Al Pacino & Marlon Brando = Drake & Jay-Z on Poundcake¬†

2638  0/100The offensive, romanticized, picture of the Corleone crime family. An Italian family in which their corrupt father manipulates and desensitizes his children to a life of brutal crime. By using the thin veil of family weddings and a reputation as The Godfather, the Corleone family have become the face of duality itself - shooting their rivals while chowing down on cannoli‚Äôs.Today was my first viewing of The Godfather. I always preferred Dunkacinno to Michael Corleone. I enjoyed my‚Ä¶  
2639 the idea of tradition versus reformation is very interesting and beautifully spun throughout the entire film within the family and within the world. I have more to say but I'm saving that for an essay I'm going to write! genuinely just a well made and well written film with much to praise.

2645  The June Challenge - Film #16Prior to watching The Godfather, I had only seen one other Francis Ford Coppola film: The Outsiders. Based on the novel of the same name, the film wasn't all that special or memorable and did what it set out to do. Just your typical run of the mill story about troubled youth. But with The Godfather, the film does what it does and it does it perfectly.I know, it's long over due for‚Ä¶

2649  The godfather is simply one of the most important and most influential motion pictures off all at time. It has everything a film needs, with some of the most impressive actors to ever live giving Oscar worthy performances of some of the most iconic characters ever put to screen, this is a film that will give you high adrenaline at some moments and will then so will quickly change its pace to make u feel such a strong sense of‚Ä¶

2655 man, i forgot how great this film is. i watched this over a year and a half ago and i loved it then, and i love it now. this felt like the shortest 3 hour film ive seen, every scene was so well made. don corleone‚Äôs dialogue is so great.¬†i haven‚Äôt seen godfather 2 before, so im planning to watch that soon for the first time, really hope it lives up to the hype.¬†top 1-2 film for me now 
2656 This movie is a rich blend of Coppola‚Äôs aesthetic genius and a triumph for Robert Evans and the architecture of the ‚Äò70s studio system. ;) 
2657 The tension and suspense are excellent, but the pacing is a bit too slow and I was never fully invested.¬†Loved the sound design and last 30 minutes 
2658 good film i like it 
2659 This is officially my favorite film OAT meaning it's simply the greatest film ever made 
2660  ‚Äúi‚Äôm gonna make him an offer he can‚Äôt refuse‚Äùi think one of my fave aspects of this film is the character development of michael. i think it‚Äôs so cool how throughout the film you get to see how he changes from this honourable, army man to this mafia man who he always tried to avoid being.one of my fave scenes of the whole film is the final scene where kay asked him if he was telling the truth‚Ä¶  
2661 the godfather: I can excuse murder, but I draw the line at drugs. 
2662 Por fin he visto El Padrino. Y si, es verdad, es un pelicul√≥n. 
2663 i was kinda into it but the only thing rly doing it for me was young al pacino 
2664  Although I vastly prefer CITIZEN KANE (1941) to THE GODFATHER (1972), one facet of both films that gives me some pause ‚Äî especially because I believe this facet has something to do with the current and unquestioned status of both movies as towering masterworks, not simply superb entertainments ‚Äî is their worship of power, including their capacity to view corruption from a corrupt vantage point. Both movies are melancholy and wistful about their conviction that corruption is an inescapable part‚Ä¶  
2665 I'm convinced nobody acutally likes this movie. It's just a big inside joke

I think it is a technically incredible film that I don‚Äôt connect with personally. The Italian mob is some gay shit fr. Need me a Ken to explain the whole movie to me.The Godfather Will Return.

2673  "The Godfather" is a true masterpiece of cinema, and a classic for the crime genre. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, the movie boasts a great plot that is very engaging. The story follows the Corleone family, one of the most powerful Mafia families in New York City, and their struggles to maintain their power and influence in the face of rival gangs and corrupt officials. The movie features a great cast, including Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and James Caan, who‚Ä¶  
2674 Don Corleone vs Tony Soprano anyone?? 
2675  It is possible for a film to be both very overrated AND very good. The Godfather is one such movie. There are a few reasons the movie doesn't quite reach masterpiece status for me. First, oddly enough, is Francis Ford Coppola's directing. While the film is in some ways very personal for Coppola, if you were to ask me to guess who directed it, I couldn't tell you. It seems that, to me, The Godfather could've been directed by any‚Ä¶

2682 ‚ÄúThe Godfather is the I Ching. The Godfather is the sum of all wisdom. The Godfather is the answer to any question. What should I pack for my summer vacation? 'Leave the gun, take the cannoli.' What day of the week is it? 'Maunday, Tuesday, Thursday, Wednesday.' And the answer to your question is 'Go to the mattresses.' You're at war.

2683 *Insert review here* 
2684 I thought it'd be overhyped like any other gangster movies but I was wrong. Totally get why it's considered to be one of the greatest and Al Pacino was such a Daddy!! The only thing that stopped me from giving it a 5 star is that it was way too long unnecessarily.

2686 Absolute classic! One of my favourite ever movies and so influential. 
2687 look how they massacred my boy 
2688  I completely understand the hype around this movie and think it deserves the rating it has, that being said, I personally didn‚Äôt love it. A great movie for sure, but didn‚Äôt have the spark, shock, or intrigue that makes me love a film.Watching again may help but at least for the first watch it just felt so long and all over the place. I was able to follow the story but jamming 10 years of events into 3 hours‚Ä¶

2694  After so many people telling me this is the best movie ever made, I finally watched it. However just like the dark knight, I found it very overrated and the three hours runtime felt so long- felt like one of the longest films I‚Äôve ever watched.¬†However I really did like don and dint find him as evil as I thought he would of been. I also really enjoyed the music as I‚Äôm half Italian my self and even though‚Ä¶  
2695  I think it is pointless at this point to articulate why ¬´The Godfather¬ª is a Masterpiece with a capital M, because everything has already been said before me. Nevertheless what stood out for me on this rewatch is how effortless every filmmaking aspect was looking. This‚Äôs a relatively simple story about Michael turning from a peaceful guy who wants to be on his own into a head of his family and crime syndicate, but Coppola executes its so meticulously and‚Ä¶

2704 Seeing The Godfather in theaters for my first watch on inaugural National Cinema Day on my 26th birthday feels almost prophetic. It was a powerhouse of acting & cinematography. An almost mythological tentpole of cinema for a reason. 
2705  The Godfather is a giant of cinema, and every detail of Francis Ford Coppola's film is perfect, from the plotting to the cinematography to Nino Rota's score. The casting is truly extraordinary. Al Pacino is my favorite as Michael, but of course Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone is one of the greatest character portrayals in movies. John Cazale as Fredo is another immortal character.The opening sequence of the film masterfully introduces the viewer to the family and all of‚Ä¶  
2706  Given how it‚Äôs a smorgasbord of pre-Vatican II Roman Catholicism, I‚Äôm shocked that converts don‚Äôt obsess over The Godfather.¬†I bristle at the notion of declaring a singular Greatest _____ of All Time, but seeing The Godfather in 35mm was an incredible experience, something that transported me back to when I first started taking movies seriously and how much this movie mattered to me then. I think that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm better armed to handle how The Godfather, memed to death‚Ä¶

2716 The Godfather is a film that makes you realise just how perfect an art form cinema can be. It‚Äôs an across the board, top to bottom, slice of cinematic perfection. Every single time I watch it, it manages to pull me into its world. Across the once in a lifetime cast, with the iconic, powerful performances from Brando, Pacino & Caan, it‚Äôs Robert Duvall‚Äôs understated portrayal of Tom Hagen that captivates me. It‚Äôs an inspired turn, full of nuance and subtlety that beautifully complements the other players.

2727 It had been years since re-visiting this all-time classic. So, seeing that this is the 50th anniversary of when it was released it seemed like it was time to watch it again. This chapter of the story deals with the passing of the Corleone torch as it goes from Marlon Brando to Al Pacino. This IS one of the greatest movies of all-time.

I did love the opening wedding sequence, all the faces and voices and colours, and in fact the whole film peaked for me when Luca Brasi was finally given the opportunity to deliver his much-rehearsed and yet still barely coherent speech to Vito Corleone.

2742  I just got back from seeing this in the theater. I‚Äôll start by saying that it is hard to remember another theatrical experience where I have been so thoroughly immersed, moved, and engaged. Seeing this on the big screen is unlike anything I‚Äôve seen before, and it elevates this masterpiece to a whole nother level.

2747  Had the opportunity to watch this on the big screen because my theatres were celebrating its 50th anniversary and I‚Äôm just so damn happy that I made up my mind to not miss it.

2781  2012 marked the 40th anniversary of Francis Ford Coppola's classic. The Godfather is no longer a film, it is a myth. The characters ‚Äî Vito Corleone, Michael, Sonny, Tom Hagen ‚Äî and scenes are so well-know that the dialogue has become part of colloquial language. "I will make him an offer that he can't refuse", "It's not personal Sonny, it's strictly business", "Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes."

2785 Not only is this the greatest film of all time, it is one of my favorite movies of all time!Everything in this is perfect. I didn‚Äôt even feel the runtime and Al Pacino and Marlon Brando are incredible. 
2786  "Mr Brando, have you thought about how you're going to play the role of Vito Corleone, the titular Godfather, in this film?""Yes, I've decided that, as I'm playing the title character, it's only right that the audience can barely understand a single fucking word I say."Let's be honest, Marlon Brando is very bad in this film. It's impossible to take him seriously when he's made the active, egotistical decision to mumble all his lines in a ridiculously cartoonish‚Ä¶

2788  "I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."The Godfather is not only regarded as one of the best family crime-dramas of all time but one of the best films period.The Corleone family is so well-written from a character standpoint, as each member has a notable role.

2795  9/10‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my family, Kay. It‚Äôs not me.‚ÄùI haven‚Äôt watched this film in years and a rewatch was definitely long overdue. This movie is just great from start to finish. When it comes down to it, it‚Äôs very tragic story about Michael Corleone. He starts as a war hero with a nice girlfriend and a tame lifestyle. However, as the mob‚Äôs war goes on, he gets sucked in and becomes more and more like something he wanted to stay‚Ä¶  
2796 i actually kinda enjoyed this </3 the filmbros won 
2797 Pretty lame that I wasn't born as an Italian Mobster in the 50s. There is absolutely nothing I can say about The Godfather that hasn't already been said before other than it's one of those few classic movies that 100% lives up to its reputation as one of the greatest films ever made. Absolutely flawless in every single way and it's never boring for a second despite the 3 hour runtime. This is about as good as a movie can possibly get. But at the end of the day I'm gonna have to give it a 0/10 needed more scenes of Vito Corleone's cat. 
2798 today was a pretty shitty day so the last thing keeping me sane is michael corleone 
2799 "leave the gun, take the cannoli!"that's how it's done 
2800 are you really italian if your dad didn‚Äôt try to scare you as a kid by telling you a horse head would be in your bed if you got in trouble 
2801  Ich hab ihn endlich gesehen! Den Paten! Und WOW! War der gut. Dieser Film ist brilliant, brillianter und am brilliantesten! Die Charaktere funktionieren und entwickeln sich nachvollziehbar, die Story ist perfekt und fesselt die ganzen drei Stunden √ºber. Der Film ist hart und h√§lt be jeglicher Gewalt drauf, was dann nochmal Nachdruck gibt, wie hart und brutal das Leben in der Mafia und die Mafia an sich sein kann. Dieser Film ist vielschichtig und schonungslos, unterhaltsam und ikonisch. Das Schauspiel‚Ä¶  
2802 The Michael-in-Sicily segment is the only thing holding this back from five stars- and there's a good chance I'll end up bumping my rating up at some point regardless. This is the perfect marriage of artistry and entertainment and I'm so glad to have finally gotten around to it. 
2803  A startling and beautiful Italian mob epic, with phenomenal performances, told with stellar direction and vision, the pacing is excellent and the story is interesting and captivating. The mood and whole feeling that surrounds the film only works to further its excellence. The sets and production value also only add to the overall nature of the film as well as the stellar score and visuals. It‚Äôs practically in my blood to watch and love this film since my family immigrated‚Ä¶  
2804  Tell me how just one 50 second Al Pacino scene from Jack & Jill entitled "Dunkaccino" can bring me out of the entirety of this masterpiece... Yeah, the hype is real, it's really good. Watched with Russian subtitles for my dad, making it so I had no idea what anyone said in Italian. I assume they were all saying "wow this Brando guy is pretty good, But Pacino? Now that guy is made for comedy, I just look at the guy‚Ä¶  
2805 I finally saw it and what a experience just captivating! 
2806 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Ok so I finally got around to watching this and wow does it live up to the hype¬†I thought the Irishman was great but this is the Irishman times 20! I can‚Äôt even express how insanely captivating this movie is to watch. I had no idea what the story was going on so when The unstoppable and godly ‚ÄúGodfather‚Äù is shot five times early in the movie I knew I was in for a ride. God what an amazing movie.  
2807 now the story of a wealthy family - who lost everything. And the one son who had no choice but to keep them all together. 
2808 doesn't take a genius to know that if a film can keep your undivided attention for close to three hours, it must either be close to or an absolute masterwork. brando literally steals the show from the first second onwards, and every scene with him oozes of cinematic excellence. it's just simply that good

2815 Few films are as vital to cinematic history as The Godfather. What an absolute classic. What I find so impressive, beyond the filmmaking itself, is how absolutely perfect this team is. From Coppola, to Brando, to Pacino, to Caan, to Gordon Willis, and beyond, every person attached to this film was absolutely perfect for the project. That doesn't happen often in film, and it's so satisfying to rewatch this knowing all of these masters put their heart and soul into this film.

2818 You can find me where I am every Thanksgiving.Watching The Family with My Family.‚ÄúA man who never spends time with his family, can never be a real man.‚ÄùHappy Thanksgiving! 
2819  Re-watched it for my Screenwriting, Directing, and Editing courses.Yeah, it's definitely amazing. The best film I've ever seen. It deserves all praises and then some. It has so many iconic scenes, from the famous "horse head" scene to the ending shootings while the children are baptized to Luca Brasi's death (that one scared me when I first saw it, because it was so disturbingly quiet) to the restaurant shooting, I could go on.The characters are all so well‚Ä¶  
2820 it only took me 23 years, but now I can officially not be bullied about not having watched this. it‚Äôs insanely well-directed and there's great performances. apart from everything amazing about this film I still do think it is a bit over hyped, which i sort of expected . anyways it‚Äôs still a great film and i‚Äôve officially entered The Godfather club. 
2821 Sometimes you realise you've seen so many references to and parodies of a film, that when you finally watch it, the brain only goes:ITALIAN-AMERICANS. YOU COME TO ME, ON THE DAY OF MY DAUGHTER'S WEDDING. SWIMMING WITH THE FISHES. BADA BING BADA BOOM. LOOK HOW THEY MASSACRED MY BOY...and most importantly 'YOUNG AL PACINO HOT'.These are about the most clear thoughts you're gonna get from me. 
2822 To describe Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather, in my humble opinion, is to quote Bernard Herrmann when he spoke of Martin Scorsese's Mean Streets:"He does it like Italian opera."Violence, betrayal, romance; it is all on display in what is easily one of the most incredible crime epics in all of film. Elegantly shot by the great Gordon Willis, scored by that great maestro Nino Rota, and starring a marvelous cast, Coppola translates Mario Puzo's chronicle of the Corleone family to the Silver Screen with great beauty, and great brutality. A true masterpiece if there ever was one. 
2823 michael corleone.... had it not been for the fact that you're fictional, i would have married you 
2824  I expected to be bored and disappointed by this film. I thought that no film is worth the amount of praise that this movie has gotten, but after watching The Godfather for the first time, I can absolutely say that it is worth all the praise it can get.‚ÄúYou talk about vengeance. Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me?‚ÄùThe writing is impeccable and that is backed by incredible performances from‚Ä¶  
2825 this movie was so captivating. i love¬†the juxtaposition of vito‚Äôs desire to be a family man yet has no problem going out and threatening his enemies - in the name of the family of course. ¬†he‚Äôs truly such a captivating character and this movie surprisingly has a lot of heart despite its harsh and heavy plot/ concept.¬†and marlon brando petting a cat while talking about negotiating a murder was truly amazing. 
2826 Masterpiece. But that James Caan fight sequence is terrible, he's out here punching nothing but air. This is what I did this morning and that's all I have to say

2828 Cinematic perfection at its finest. 
2829 sonny with a chance??? more like sonny didn't have a chance. am i right ladies!! 
2830 What a film√®. 
2831  I thought long and hard on how I want to word my love for The Godfather. I didn't want to say something that has already been said, yet it's so hard not to. Everything technically and thematically about this film has already been said. Everything is damn near flawless, through stunning execution for one of the masters of cinema, Francis Ford Coppola. The generational themes of how mistakes are repeated, and the "do what I say, not what I do"‚Ä¶  
2832 Werk. 
2833 Most people seem to prefer "The Godfather: Part ll", but this one is my favorite. I love Marlon Brando, and I love Al Pacino's slow transformation from good guy to bad guy.¬†Also, I love the scene in the beginning where Marlon Brando is sitting at his desk and the cat is in his lap grabbing at his hands, wanting to play. That cat totally steals the scene! :D 
2834  What do I have to say about "The Godfather" that hasn't been said before? Whether it's the iconic score, riveting storytelling, brisk pacing, stellar direction, beautiful cinematography, the unbelievable tension and unpredictability, pitch perfect screenplay with so much gripping dialogue and most importantly the unforgettable performances and characters, this is truly not only about as flawless and as much of a masterpiece as the mobster genre, but film in general. And a lot of that is also thanks to how‚Ä¶  
2835  Michael's descent seems abrupt until you notice how his eyes drop as he tells Kay about the bandleader. And then he finishes it with "that's a true story." In that caesura, you can already see the man who will stare and consider and regret his decisions at Lake Tahoe. Michael himself certainly sees that man when he makes his fatal decision at the restaurant, his eyes darting around, cycling through the decades of feelings and family lessons that led him‚Ä¶  
2836 I listened to the director's commentary this time and it was well worth it. Coppola shares gems of information that I hadn't heard before and it was interesting to hear the real life drama playing out while filming was going on. 
2837  Classics are so fucking hard to review. What can I possibly say about this film that you don't already know? All you have to do is look at my rating and you can easily guess why I rated it so. If I was giving it 1 star then maybe I'd have something to add, but I didn't... so I don't.I will say though that this is a lot more restrained then I was anticipating. Having watched a good chunk‚Ä¶  
2838  "But I never wanted this for you. I worked my whole life. I don't apologize for taking care for my family. And I refused to be a fool, dancing on a string held by all those big shots. I dont apologize, that's my life but I thought that..when it was your time, you would be the one to hold the strings."That conversation between Michael and Vito in the garden, before the eventual demise of the Don himself a scene‚Ä¶  
2839  How does one begin to describe a film like The Godfather? Many call it a "masterpiece," and I disagree with them. A masterpiece implies perfection and, in my opinion, no film will ever achieve perfection. But The Godfather comes pretty damn close.Most already know the story of The Godfather. It's a narrative that's complex, yet simple and it's story that's fluid and interesting. It's complicated, but the story is told with such ease, it's like watching a master artist‚Ä¶  
2840 Wanted to watch the first half and go to bed. Watched the entire thing and am seriously considering putting part II on.I guess that says it all. 
2841  I love this movie. The theme of the aging patriarch Don Vito Corleone as he tries to maintain his way of life in a changing world could be about any family business and not just the mafia. He has aspirations for his family but is forced to realize they many not come true during his time. This is one of the best ensemble casts ever and it is impossible to single out just one performance‚Ä¶Marlon Brando, James Caan, Al Pacino,‚Ä¶

2845 In younger days -- before properly understanding that film is a visual medium -- I used to think that the Godfather was overrated. Now that I know how to look at a movie as a visual experience I can safely say that the Godfather is close to being an absolute masterpiece. The cinematography here by Gordon Willis is extraordinary.

2854  A masterpiece so towering and enthralling that having finally seen it, I'm kinda ticked that my professor picked and chose certain scenes to play in class beforehand to emphasize Nino Rota's score (or lack thereof), if only because I didn't first experience them in their proper context. In retrospect, I understand showing the opening titles and the horse's head‚Äîit happens fairly early on, it's a well-known shock, and Rota executes the ominous buildup well before stopping hard for Woltz's scream‚Ä¶

2863 The new 4K restoration looks incredible. That warm glow that‚Äôs all over the film is even more pronounced. Like watching an old family photograph come to life‚Äîbringing out all of its particular melancholy feelings. Of course that beauty is masterfully contrasted by the violence. With many classics like this it‚Äôs another case of what‚Äôs been said has been said and there‚Äôs nothing more to be said.

2875  This film hits all the marks without resulting to cheap gore and over the top performances. One really does feel as if they are a part of the Corleone family. Coppola managed to take a concept as dark and dangerous as the mob and humanize it, creating a full-circle story that makes the viewer feel pain, joy, familial bonds, anger, justice and injustice, throughout.

2879 For my 2,000th film on Letterboxd, I tried to find a virtually unknown film and shed some light on it, so hopefully it could get a little more recognition. As it turns out, the 1972 mafia drama The Godfather is pretty good, with great turns from all involved, especially Brando and Pacino in the leading roles. I won't say more to preserve the mystery of the narrative, but overall, it's quite a picture. 
2880  Das lange Warten hat sich gelohnt.¬†Im (fast) vollst√§ndigen Umkreis meiner Liebsten, mit einem gemeinsamen Abendessen und ein paar belebten Gespr√§chen zeremonierend, dass nun endlich der Tag gekommen war, an dem meine weitge√∂ffneten, erwartungsvollen Augen The Godfather¬†erblicken w√ºrden.¬†Ich denke auf keinem Film lastet solch eine B√ºrde, wie auf diesem hier. Daf√ºr ist allein Letterboxd schon ein Paradebeispiel. Eine Durchschnittswertung von 4.6, was bei knapp 600.000 Sichtungen eigentlich undenkbar ist. Ein Blick auf die Reviews, die einen halben Stern vergeben‚Ä¶  
2881 baby's first godfather where do i begin?to tell the story of how much '70s al pacino means to methe simple truth about the love he brings to mewhere do i start? 
2882  Look, this is a classic and everything, and I absolutely see why. It's technically brilliant. A masterclass in building tension. The scenes are gorgeously paced, something I feel I should now come to expect from FF Coppola. It's a great film to study, so from a film student point of view, I could justify every second I spent on this. But apart from that, just for the story? To say it's past its time is an understatement. It's disgustingly sexist,‚Ä¶  
2883  Road to CodaI don‚Äôt know how many times I‚Äôve seen this fill to be completely honest with you. I‚Äôve lost count. It‚Äôs a sprawling, brutal, emotional, and addictive epic that, to this day, continues to stand the test of time. From the use of natural light to increase the omnipotence of Marlon Brando‚Äôs Vito, or the beautiful score from Nino Rota, there is truly so much to ‚ÄòThe Godfather‚Äô. It‚Äôs difficult to find films that are so mind-numbingly impressive‚Ä¶  
2884  ‚Äúbecause i believe this drug business is gonna destroy us in the years to come. i mean, it's not like gambling or liquor, even women, which is something that most people want nowadays, and it's forbidden to them by the church.‚Äùso much foreshadowing in that scene, especially after that quote, but i‚Äôm trying to avoid spoilers so that‚Äôs all i‚Äôll say regarding that. at its core, The Godfather is a family film. that‚Äôs why it was fitting for me‚Ä¶

2895 ‚ÄúLeave the gun. Take the cannoli.‚ÄùThe definitive gangster film. The Godfather¬†is a film I should‚Äôve seen years ago, it‚Äôs absolutely legendary. Went in with very high expectations, and I wasn‚Äôt disappointed.Marlon Brando and Al Pacino give phenomenal performances here. They absolutely carry any scene they‚Äôre in. The writing is fantastic; this almost 3 hour film never feels convoluted and no scene feels unnecessary.¬†I‚Äôm glad I finally got around to The Godfather, it‚Äôs safe to say that it‚Äôs a masterpiece. On to part 2! 
2896 bruh maybe im just not in the right mood but this wasn‚Äôt really my thing. i find it extremely boring when a director refuses to experiment with the camera or with the cinematic medium 
2897 One of Coppola's masterpieces, for sure. With a gleaming, star-studded cast that all deliver on their performances, and an engaging, gritty, unapologetic story that - ultimately - tends toward the bleak. As a movie about the mafia should. 
2898 the scene where the priest asks michael if he renounces satan & he does and it cuts to all the killing scenes. a big fat mood 
2899 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   If this was compared to Goodfellas, Goodfellas would be a masterpiece.Now, this film isn't poorly made, it is actually a well-made film. However, there is one little thing that is not the best in this film, and that is everything else. Let's start with the first glaring mistake: it being overlong and poorly-paced. With 120 minutes left in the film, our main protagonist makes his move for revenge on the person who killed his fiancee. Our protagonist beats him‚Ä¶   
2900 All due respect, Don Corleone, but if this movie proves anything it's that women, contrary to what you say, really cannot afford to be careless.It's unsettling how much this now plays like a diagnosis of America's present state of crisis. Scenes feel like they were written just this month as a commentary.But Keaton's hair remains firmly rooted in the '40s. 
2901 Seeing one of my all time favorite movies on the big screen in my favorite city in the world is the best birthday gift I could ask for. 
2902 Finally i've earned the "this is cinema üö¨" pass.No quiero sonar pedante pero es que merece tan alta nota. Recorremos la vida de la familia Corleone en un metraje de 3horas que se me han hecho muy amenas e interesantes. Est√° llena de momentazos, donde la tensi√≥n y el asombro se contagian al espectador. La parte de Italia tiene una belleza campechana muy chula, y Vitto Corleone es maj√≠simo.

2906 The Michael/Fredo relationship and arc is so gut wrenching and painful. 
2907  I finally watched The Movie and unfortunately it was good. admittedly i watched it in 2 sittings because it's too damn long and i got sleepy. it may have started a bit slow but it's the type of movie that gets progressively better all the way up to the last second. I liked the parallel portrayal of Vito's deteriorating health and becoming a silly fragile old man that cares about his family more than anything and easily passes the mantle‚Ä¶  
2908 rewatched because al pacino is so sexy 
2909 ‚Äúi‚Äôm gonna make him an offer he can‚Äôt refuse‚Äùgive my dog a little bit of cheese so he gives me back my sock 
2910  The use of silhouettes and shadows in here (especially in how they reflect Michael‚Äôs descent into the world of organized crime) is just masterful. An extraordinary achievement that‚Äôs earned every ounce of its praise. ‚ÄúI believe in America‚Äù, so says the films opening line. The Godfather is a movie that believes in America for what it is: a land of cyclical violence that leaves no victors or heroes, just corpses. Like so many great pieces of art (from classic literature‚Ä¶

Al√©m disso, √© muito imersivo, bem ritmado e desenvolve seus personagens de um jeito impec√°vel; especialmente Michael e Don Corleone, que s√≥ se tornam cada vez mais interessantes ao desenrolar do filme.

2930  It took long enough to happen, but here we are. I finally watched The Godfather. I have no clue where to begin. Genuinely. I feel like anything I attempt to say won‚Äôt even do this movie justice on what this viewing experience was like for me. For me, The Godfather transcends storytelling as a visual art by creating a real, vicarious, utterly compelling narrative. Everything in this film fits, like a 175 minute puzzle where all the pieces work together‚Ä¶  
2931 =All right, you just shot them both. Now what do you do?-Sit down and finish my dinner. 
2932  ‚ÄúWould you like me more if I were Ingrid Bergman?‚Äù‚ÄúNow there's a thought...‚ÄùEven though I was fairly confident going into it that I would enjoy the film, I did have some scepticism around just how much that enjoyment would stretch. I've got to say I am thoroughly impressed! This was considerably more engaging and interesting of a story than I had anticipated it being and the 2 hours and 55 minutes flew by with relative ease. There's not‚Ä¶  
2933 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  That one "All your favorite characters will be unceremoniously dispatched" tweet but with Don Corleone playing in the garden with his grandson  
2934 had to show this to my bf he‚Äôs so uneducated 
2935 Some movies are so iconic and recognizable that you pretty much know every scene, frame, line of dialog before you ever watch it. Films like this, 2001, 12 Angry Men, Citizen Kane etc. thankfully I watched the Godfather Trilogy as a kid so I didn‚Äôt have it ruined and I‚Äôm thankful for that, because these movies really are something special. They are slightly overhyped but a great movie is a great movie no matter how you crack it. 
2936 The Godfather is a cinematic masterpiece that weaves a gripping tale of power, family, and consequences. With iconic performances by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, coupled with atmospheric cinematography and a haunting score, the film sets the standard for excellence in storytelling and remains an immortal classic in the realm of cinema. Also very little known fact Francis Ford coppola is Nicholas cage and Jason's schwartsmans uncle 
2937  it's not a perfect movie, but it's quite good and quite enjoyable. not a terrible way to start the year i'd say. there's a lot about this film that is strong. do i need to tell you that? i mean i'm coming here over 50 years late with this review to tell you that a widely-beloved classic is good. i guess that's somewhat uncommon actually since i tend to find a lot of the classics in the typical western film‚Ä¶  
2938 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Sonny Corleone man. There's something so captivating about his character that I'm addicted to every time I watch this, which is a lot. From the moment you meet him you can tell his downfall is right around the corner. The way he bites his fist after hearing that Carlo's done it again. It's obvious that it's over for him as soon as he races for the car. Himself and Fredo are two sides of the same coin, both too emotional for the lives they lead. James Caan is fucking explosive man. Touch my sistah again I'll kill ya.  
2939  In my top 10-15 movies rn (was already probably just been a long time)¬†It is difficult to design a story that makes its audience commiserate with a person of wicked and sinful nature and the godfather executed that amazingly. We also know that the way to reach a complete state of evil is not an instant choice but a slow and dark burning process within a person‚Äôs soul. I find it interesting that Francis Ford Coppola‚Äôs The Godfather (1972)‚Ä¶  
2940  A decade in the life of a nice Italian-American family in New York.Sweeping, grandiose, and intimate. Violence begets violence, revenge begets revenge, the good are corrupted. The old story.The passage of time is surprising every time I watch this. Thirty minutes spent on a single wedding then jump after jump after jump.A quibble: Luca Brasi is Don Corleone's chief enforcer, the one person that could not be stopped from vengeance if the Don were to be murdered,‚Ä¶

2945  The Godfather is a sleazy grime-fest of a crime narrative; a self-contained epic wherein tribalistic feuds, familial pride¬†and short tempers reign supreme.¬†The Godfather is methodical in its 3h runtime, letting its audience learn the ins and outs of the Corleone family; the hierarchy of the patriarchs, their loyalties, their motivations, so on and so forth. While intricate detail for each and every character is spared, inspired casting and pragmatic acting from the entire cast lends the fictional family a‚Ä¶  
2946 üòÆ‚Äçüí® no words. Ready for PART 2! 
2947  I recently read the novel and I know ‚Äúyou shouldn‚Äôt compare movies and books‚Äù but genuinely this is better in every possible way. It‚Äôs fascinating because it‚Äôs a really faithful adaptation, yet Coppola adds so much lyricism and weight to every single moment. While I do think Puzo deserves credit for fashioning so much of this world, his novel has no sense of character (spending so much pointless time with Johnny Fontaine) and certainly almost nothing of metaphor. I know‚Ä¶  
2948  What more can be said about The Godfather other than it is nothing short of a masterwork. The casting is perfect. Marlon Brando is the perfect actor for Don Vito Corleone. He physically embodies the part. His smooth voice, mustache and his calm but dangerous demeanor compliments the character. Al Pacino was a fresh face at this time and I think that it was the right move to choose an unknown actor for the role of Michael. James Caan, Robert‚Ä¶

2953 Worst price of trash I have ever seen, no wonder everyone hates it. 0/10 would NOT recommend! 
2954  It took me two rewatches to see the absolute majestic stuff in this that the majority of cinephiles in here have been praising. During my initial watch, I found the plot a bit dull and remembering so many names and faces tiresome but this time everything connected with me. The characters are all super entertaining to watch and perfectly casted although the actress who played Connie was a bit cartoonish with her performance. This is the kind of raw filmmaking‚Ä¶  
2955 Quickest 3 hours of my life. Continues to be one of the best movies I‚Äôve ever seen. I absolutely love every second. Idk how Coppola made this honestly after seeing his previous films now. The guys back was against the wall, didn‚Äôt even want to make the movie in the first place, and he ends up making arguably the greatest movie of all time. Incredible. 
2956 I can finally say I‚Äôve seen The Godfather! What can you say about a film like this? It‚Äôs been parodied and referenced so heavily in pop culture that I knew many of the plot points before going in, but I still thoroughly enjoyed it. Every performance is terrific, and Coppola is an absolute genius with the directing. This film is gorgeous, and the story itself is thrilling to watch. I had some issues with the pacing around the two hour mark, but it soon got back on track and delivered a fantastic ending.Filling in my Pop Culture Blind Spots. 
2957 N√£o sei porque demorei tanto para assistir esse, achei que era superestimado demais e tal, mas me surpreendi e realmente √© um dos melhores filmes que j√° vi. Achei tudo t√£o bem constru√≠do e dram√°tico, n√£o espera que me prenderia do inicio ao fim. Da para entender o porque dele ser t√£o referenciado em obras que envolve m√°fia e fam√≠lias italianas. Sem contar na atua√ß√£o perfeita do Marlon Brando, pra mim o melhor de todos nesse primeiro filme.

It‚Äôs unbelievable how he plays this role. Even the scuffed fight between Sunny¬†and Carlo¬†doesn‚Äôt bother me as much.This film is perfect from the moment Don¬†dies.

However i cannot deny it‚Äôs exquisite craftsmanship. yes i enjoyed Scarface more maybe due to my age so eventually i‚Äôll revisit this and perhaps then i‚Äôll be able to resonate with nearly everyone else in their adoration for The Godfather.¬† 
2986  I doubt I have anything new to say about this film. It‚Äôs rather like visiting with an old friend.The best Mafia movies are often about something more than the Mafia, and this fits that criterion to a T. In fact, I would argue it‚Äôs not even a Mafia movie (Goodfellas is a Mafia movie). Made and released in the midst of Vietnam and Watergate, The Godfather is really about the corruption of The American Dream. The first line says‚Ä¶  
2987  "I'm gonna make him an offer he can‚Äôt refuse."I figured it was only fitting that I watched my 700th movie on my birthday lol. Yes, I have finally watched this absolute classic. And yes, it is indeed fantastic. I mean, do I even need to explain why really? After all, this is seen by many people to be one of the greatest, if not the greatest, movies ever made.

2992 I went into this movie with the highest expectations possible, after everything I‚Äôve heard about it actually being the greatest movie of all time and making every websites top 5 list.I really liked it but it was pretty slowed paced in the first 40 minutes and I do think it could‚Äôve been shorter. It‚Äôs a great movie but it‚Äôs very overrated. 
2993  This film is amazing in every way possible. The film making is gorgeous, the screenplay is excellent, and the acting performances are full of passion. Right from the moment you start watching it, you feel integrated into the world. The Godfather showcases so much about family, politics, distrust, and changes over time. The character progression in this film, especially with Michael, feels organic and is shown so well. It‚Äôs interesting to see how Michael initially wants to be separated from‚Ä¶

2996  Haven't watched this in years but oooh man, this was special. Funny how it always played every Christmas at like 10 on RTE and I just decided randomly to put it on. Finding it difficult to put into words how good The Godfather is. It's long but every frame is dripping with something special going on. Iconic images establishing a cinematic pulse that will have a lasting legacy. Opening with our Don Corleone stroking a feline, Luca Brazi's bulging eyeballs,‚Ä¶

3000 I don't think I can say anything that hasn't been said after watching this. One of the least controversial opinions when it comes to film is that The Godfather is an absolute masterpiece, and I can see why. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino give amazing performances here, and it's depictions of crime, power and corruption are breathtaking. I don't think I can say anything that hasn't already been said, except that I can't believe it took me this long to get around to it.The three hour runtime is perhaps the only detriment, but at least I was engaged throughout.

3011 a lot of people will say this is a masterpiece, and you know what, i won't argue with them. but really this is a lesson from francis ford coppola about how young al pacino and young robert de niro are hot 
3012  It‚Äôs easy to assume that a complex plot is a sign of a great film. But the best films are deceptively simple in the same way that the greatest dancers make their movements look astonishingly easy. The Godfather creates its world so gracefully that we begin to think that it's a straightforward tale. But it's not simple to create a world so morally ambiguous, to introduce unforgettable characters, and to keep viewers fully cognizant of a plot so dense.The‚Ä¶

3036  Making a sequel that can manage to live up to the expectations of the original is an achievement in itself. But when the original film is being universally hailed as the greatest motion picture ever made, measuring up to that same feat is undeniably a near impossible task. But then, that‚Äôs exactly what The Godfather Part II manages to accomplish by building upon the original in ways most sequels never dare to and is possibly the only film in existence‚Ä¶  
3037 it‚Äôs time for the girls to reclaim this movie from film bros. it literally has both al pacino and robert de niro at their peak hotness!! and the scene where al pacino sucks on an orange!!! yeah the plot and stuff is good i guess but COME ON¬† 
3038 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   The Godfather: Part II is superior to the first film. Nothing lulls like the original, and the dual story is a genius conceit that allows new depth. It is more vague, stuck in history and not just a single fictional, self-contained story. The Godfather: Part II is a story with no borders, crossing decades, timelines, and without a beginning nor an end. It is richer and smarter and more complex than The Godfather, bringing real history, from the Cuban Revolution‚Ä¶   
3039 One of the best sequels ever to be made. 
3040  The Godfather¬†is a film I‚Äôd call exceptional. It‚Äôs near-perfect on just about every level. The acting is strong, the filmmaking is top notch, and the characters, dialogue, and narrative are all very much captivating. Deliberately paced for sure, but the film utilizes its slow pace to its full potential, all building up to what is a strong contender for one of the most memorable endings I‚Äôve ever seen.As for The Godfather Part II, I‚Äôm not going to lie, but‚Ä¶

3042  To me, there‚Äôs no question: The Godfather is better than Godfather Part II ‚Äî¬†but Part II could have been better, if they had gotten Richard Castellano back as Clemenza as Coppola originally intended. The reason why he didn‚Äôt return varies by the source ‚Äî according to some accounts he wanted to write his own dialogue, in others he simply refused his character‚Äôs arc ‚Äî but either way, replacing him was a significant loss for the film. Michael‚Äôs storyline, and its‚Ä¶

3044  The Godfather 2 is outstanding. I do believe it‚Äôs better than the original. I‚Äôm so amazed because I rarely ever think a sequel is better than the original, but The Godfather 2 pulled it off. Everything about this movie is extraordinary from the plot to the score. This has to be one of the best films of all time, and one of my personal favorites. After the first hour of this film, I was unsure that it would be better‚Ä¶

3047 there could be novels written about the lighting in this. the shadows! the hues! the way someone's eyes will be covered in blackness! that moment when a man is being killed in the bar and a cop walks in and says "jeez it's dark I can't tell if it's open or closed," and the shadows are all around like molasses or coal! sometimes I couldn't even concentrate on the story I was just staring at the shadows. 
3048  The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire.How do you take arguably the greatest film ever made‚Ä¶and make it better? Such layered characterization and storytelling, its simply Coppola at his best as he creates the greatest sequel ever. The almost tragic concurring timeline‚Äôs seen between Michael‚Äôs fall into the abyss and losing his family in pursuit of a power he never wanted and his father‚Äôs rise to power in hope‚Äôs of creating a better life for his family, is‚Ä¶  
3049 Watching movies of this caliber just hit on a different level. It‚Äôs been heralded so much that that none of my words can do it any more justice so yeah it‚Äôs as good as everyone says it is. It‚Äôs pretty much as good as filmmaking can get. In fact, most of the time it doesn‚Äôt even feel like it was meticulously crafted by someone. It just exists in a realm of mere tangibility.1 > 2. I think...Coppola Ranked List 
3050 tbh one of the most tragic movies ever made, Vito‚Äôs optimism and love for family starkly contrasted against Michael turning the family into a business, the early century turn to late stage capitalism made so horrifyingly tangible that it practically kills everyone who dares to try and conquer it. better than the first by a decent margin i think

3052  Time to talk about an exceptional one-of-a-kind continuation of a masterpiece that acts as both a prequel with the rise of Don Vito Corleone, and a sequel as we see his son and successor Michael's descent into darkness ...

I like how bleak part 2 is, but it really takes its time to‚Ä¶

3055 Incredibly, "Godfather 2" manages to top its wildly popular predecessor "Who's Your Daddy, Baby".

3060  The Godfather: Part II expands what in the first chapter of the saga was considered to have already happened and - at the sime time - completes the plan for the insertion of the Corleone family into the fabric of contemporary American society. Francis Ford Coppola articulates this second "episode" on two parallel and intersecting levels which almost seem to chase each other between past and present. On the one hand he describes how the godfather became such, starting from‚Ä¶  
3061 What‚Äôs not to love about this film? We get more Godfather. This film is great because Part I existed and we get a continuation of one of the greatest stories ever told. The Godfather Part II holds onto the theme of the first film while adding to the story and characters in its own way. This is a perfect example on how to make a great sequel. It continues the story with the same styles and techniques as the first film while bringing more depth and more development to the table. 
3062  Part II might be better than the first one. The juxtaposition of young Vito building the family and Michael tearing it apart continues the corruption arc of Michael's character and adds a refresshing new layer to the film's story and pace (whenever it seems like it's about to get boring it cuts to young Vito and quickly picks up again). Robert De Niro is the easy standout, but I have to give credit to John Cazale for his heartbreaking (get‚Ä¶  
3063 Al Pacino's eye movement is some of the best acting I've ever seen in my entire life. As Michael Corleone he's able to masterfully convey calculated, disciplined, and heartless emotions all in the span of 3 hours. He's always studying into everybody else's soul while losing his own 
3064  The Godfather: Part II is an absolute cinematic masterpiece. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, it takes the classic narrative of the original and explores it even further, creating a truly captivating and powerful story. The film continues to set the bar for some of the greatest television and film of all time and over forty years after its release, remains as powerful and influential as ever.¬†It's hard to believe that such an incredible cast of actors were present: Robert De‚Ä¶

3066  Michael Corleone: "I know it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart.

He chose Martin Scorsese, who the film executives rejected. Coppola finally agreed to direct the film, with a few conditions. Also, Robert De Niro spent four months learning to speak the Sicilian dialect of Italian in‚Ä¶  
3067  Is it better than The Godfather? I don't think so, heres why:The cast is thinned down, weaker and less bonded in the Micheal Corleone continuation. Not much to that story really develops apart from Micheal's continued path towards complete power and the demise of his family and values as a result. The story of Vito however elevates the film structure and style. In many ways this story alone is superior to the first film in its simple linear plot,‚Ä¶  
3068  Fun fact: I have a close relationship with this movie as one of the camera assistants on the Havanna shootings (actually they were done here on Dominican Republic) was one of my teachers on film school.Its certainly a new experience looking at this film as a grown up YA than as a 15 year old kid. It also helps the fact that there was no commercial, like, man, I remember watching this on TV at 12pm and the movie‚Ä¶  
3069  There are almost as many great scenes as the first one, but barely any of the dramatic shape. The big operatic dramatic scale Coppola hopes for does keep the emotional flow consistent, but it does struggle to move from one moment to another. Some of the dramatic limitations are self-inflected; the flashbacks are a very good self-contained movie that really struggles to belong to the whole thing besides the least interesting mirror, some are not, as good as Gazzo is,‚Ä¶  
3070 The tragedy of a penniless man's unbound honourable crusade, rich in sacramental duty, to provide for his family, nurturing an infallible empire of love and respect - and it all decaying to betrayal and malice. Usurped by the perilous trade of passing time and rife occupation, nobility can only be fruitless under the aching temptations of capitalism; especially in the callow hands of those that have never been blemished by its sinful treachery.

3073  Michael Corleone has come a long way.His descent into pure evil is accompanied by his father's ascent to prestige. Coppola's sequel is an emotionally gripping, abnormally realistic feeling dark tale of a man whose thirst for vengeance, unyielding strive for power has cost him everything. Neither was Michael able to hold on to his most beloved members of the family, he indeed has gone as far as perpetrating an act that would vitiate the basis the Corleone family was‚Ä¶

3079 While not quite as eminently enjoyable as its predecessor, The Godfather: Part II¬†excels in its ambition.

3086  67/100Third viewing, last seen 2011. Still think the Greatest Sequel Ever Made is "merely" far superior to your standard superfluous continuation‚ÄîI didn't need to see Michael grow ever more ruthless and isolated, nor did I particularly care about Vito's backstory (wisely omitted from the original film), so it's a testament to Coppola & Co. firing on all cylinders that I'm happy to watch those two threads alternate for well over three hours.

3088 Coppola pushes the boundaries of his now epic saga in a new delivery of exceptional storytelling and an enthralling and epic structure. De Niro's addition is a fantastic decision by the visionary Coppola; the 70s were the best time to tell such a magnificent story. A splendid cast still fills the screen; nevertheless, it is its natural and unforced direction that makes of The Godfather, Part II one of the best American movies ever made. It is a mood that does not prevail in modern cinema anymore.98/100 
3089 Family is unequivocally everything 
3090  When the family business becomes family and business. Coppola's film is at once manic and guarded, like a father running off to Vegas unannounced, planning to gamble away his fortune on blackjack‚Äîthe best odds‚Äîonly to blow it all on slots in the heat of the moment. The juxtaposition of Vito and Michael serves not just to emphasize "like father, like son," but also the inevitability of change, both in their hands and the world's; like both men, the game is‚Ä¶  
3091 i know it was you Fredo. you broke my heart. you broke my heart!this is probably one of the saddest movies ever tbh. in it's entire length of 202 minutes, not a single second is wasted. this is perfect and there's nothing much to say that hasn't already been said before!seeing michael become more and more lonely has the story goes on just breaks my heart everytime ): the ending always leaves me sad with fredo being k!lled in the lake and michael shutting the door on kay once again <\3 
3092  A morbid atmosphere, creating parallels between past and present ,and it's bigger and more poignant than the first opus, this time centred on the gradual fall of Michael Corleone and Vito's past, played by a De Niro at the height of his charisma in an even more masterful artistic direction. The psychology is more terrifying than ever, and the challenges are amplified by the coldness of Michael trying to be like his late father, but never succeeding. The psychology is‚Ä¶  
3093  100 (The Coppola Restoration)I‚Äôll make the obligatory ‚Äúit‚Äôs the greatest sequel of all time‚Äù claim because it is indeed the greatest sequel of all time. But you already know that. The rise and fall of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) as the Don is the polar opposite of his father‚Äôs demise and I‚Äôve always found that to be what sticks with me the most. The story of a rising young and respectable Vito Corleone (Robert de Niro) being paired with‚Ä¶  
3094 The relationship between Michael and Fredo here is truly one of the most tragic stories ever told.

I¬†think I‚Äôm firmly within the camp with those who believe that this is even better than the original - in fact, it‚Äôs getting to the point where I‚Äôd even consider this to be arguably my personal favourite film. A completely flawless piece of cinema with some of the most densely layered storytelling to ever be put to a screen.

3098 Al Pacino was superb in this instalment. So evil and sinister. I love how this movie follows on and develops from the first. I also loved Robert De Niro playing a young Vito. Diane Keaton also had more to do in this one. I was enjoying the first hour even better than the original. I really felt the runtime of this one by the end though. Wow, it‚Äôs been so long since I‚Äôve seen an intermission in a movie. 
3099 Best film in the history of cinema.I remember this was the first time I saw Al Pacino and De Niro in the same film and though they don‚Äôt share screen because it‚Äôs a different timeline, it absolutely blown my mind to see these two legends ‚Äútogether‚Äù.¬†It‚Äôs just one of those movies where everything is perfect. Flawless. 
3100  I remembered parts of this movie, but it felt like a borderline first time viewing for me. What a brilliant sequel that intertwines the young Vito storyline with the present day Michael plot. It expands upon the story of the original‚Äîfurther exploring the Corleone family‚Äôs dominant presence as the top dogs of the mob. Over the course of two movies, Michael Corleone‚Äôs gradual change from military hero to villainous mobster is about as perfect as it gets when it comes‚Ä¶  
3101 Well, they're right. The Godfather Part II is a much better film than the first one. This sequel provides even more rich and brilliantly crafted storytelling (the back-to-back stories of Michael and Young Vito were just outstanding), the themes were even stronger, the ending was much more powerful than the first one, the performances from the cast were top notch as always, and the family drama here was ten times better.

3104 When Connie calls Anthony to come out of the boat because Michael has plans to depart to Reno, does Fredo know at that moment what's going on?¬†The Godfather II is a Cinematic Masterpiece. 
3105  as outlined in my review for The Godfather subsequently all of the said can be read in bigger parantheses: a patriarchy that only knows aggression, blood and death. the destruction drive in full effect. the processes are already completely technocratic. no affection ("don't hate your enemy, it's all business"), keep all emotions, all attachment to any objects out. the risk of getting "in touch" with the (also own) feminine side might be: the total breakdown and eventual annihilation of a‚Ä¶  
3106  Holy fucking wow. How can something perfectly match, if not better it‚Äôs predecessor so well, which in itself was magnificent?¬†With The Godfather‚Äôs amazing story and characters¬†fresh in my mind I felt the need to instantly jump straight into it‚Äôs sequel, and boy am I glad I did. Some of the most convincing performances I‚Äôve seen were on display yet again here, feats of acting that very few get close to even today. I am jealous of every single person‚Ä¶  
3107 I haven't been blown away by a sequel this much The Empire Strikes Back. Both Part I and Part II build on each other so beautifully. I really can‚Äôt decide which one I like better. I feel like 1 had the better characters and scenes but 2 had the better story and pacing. Either way, this 2 part 6 and a half hour mafia epic is incredible.

3110  'The Godfather: Part Il', directed by Francis Ford Coppola in 1974, is a very successful sequel and one of the best of all time. Nevertheless, in my opinion it can't keep up with the first part, as I liked the story of the first part a little more. Don't get me wrong, the film is terrific, which is why I give it 4.5 stars, it's just that the first one was so fanatical. So now back to the first part.‚Ä¶  
3111  I keep forgetting what a masterpiece this film is. The acting, the setting, the pacing and the absolutely legendary soundtrack. Robert De Niro plays Vito Corleone so well that you don't miss Marlon Brando. Even so, I still prefer Mr. Brando as Don Vito Corleone. Al Pacino plays terrific and I say it again and again, probably the best performance. Many scenes still give you goosebumps. I would describe this film as completely perfect. Nevertheless, I still favor Part 1‚Ä¶

3114  Truthfully, i love how part 2 dives more deeper into the characters development especially the Corleone family. The themes of betrayal & greed here was very tangible & utilized very well thanks to the impeccable direction by CoppolaI particularly love the backstory of the young Vito Corleone played by Robert de Niro as we witness his early life & career. I love his particular character & he's probably the best character I've seen in the franchise. He was so kind, caring and helpful‚Ä¶

3117  The Godfather Part II is a stunning sequel to the phenomenal original feature.In terms of storytelling this sequel picks up the themes of the original and follows Michael Corleone‚Äôs descent into corruption even further as he goes from ordering deaths to turning on his own family. Coppola brilliantly reinforces the theme of the Immigrants view of the American dream in the Early Twentieth century becoming corrupted as individuals begin to abuse the power they gain through illegal means.

3118  One night around Christmas Eve 1974, my biological Grandfather disappeared, then turned up dead in the south branch of the Chicago River the following month. My Grandmother said he had planned to see The Godfather, Part II that night. It‚Äôs a mystery whether he was murdered or if he drunkenly killed himself. It‚Äôs a mystery whether or not he even saw the film.¬†49 years later, on Christmas Night 2023, I watched The Godfather, Part II for the first time,‚Ä¶  
3119  50th Anniversary!Oscar weekend watch!Random thoughts. Not a review. What could I say that hasn't already, except to say with every viewing I have varying experiences all of them exceptional. This time I was really struck by the emotional tragic fall of brotherly love. John Cazale is exceptional at conveying innocence and guilt. An older brother who never really grew up or got the respect he craved. The way he looks at Tony and their embrace near the ending‚Ä¶  
3120 It's funny to say this about a mafia movie but truly the dichotomy in storytelling is about power through community building and power that creates isolation. How coming from nothing informs helping those with smaller issues. Fighting a war for your street or your nation is a form of idealism. And when you are building an empire, everyone is an enemy, including family. That's the tipping point. 
3121 mfs really come on this app to lie and say this is better than the first one 
3122 WARNING: DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!!! I watched it and now I suffer from a rare condition called SPONTANEOUS ORGASMS!!!!!!!! One second I‚Äôm out here living my life, and the next I think about Al Pacino in suspenders or Robert Deniro with that mustache and BOOM!!!!! ORGASM!!!!!! This condition has ruined my life. I have been laid off from work. I haven‚Äôt seen my children in three years. My ex husband refuses to see me. If you are happy with your life, please do not see this movie. It ruined mine </3. 
3123  After seeing the Godfather twice in the past week I felt ready to watch the sequel. Over the years I've heard that this is one of, if not the best sequel ever made. After seeing it for myself I can conclude that this is one of the best sequels ever made. However, The Godfather part 2 isn't as much a sequel as much as it is a continuation of the first film.¬†The plot to this film takes place before‚Ä¶  
3124 I'm probably wrong, but this is superior to Part 1. 
3125 Pretty good sequel, but it‚Äôs no The Dark Knight, Terminator 2, The Empire Strikes Back, Spider-Man 2, or Blade Runner 2049. 
3126 This might just be the greatest sequel ever made. Robert De Niro took on the practically impossible task of living up to Marlon Brando‚Äôs portrayal of Vito, but he handles it masterfully, incorporating nuances of Brando‚Äôs performance (tone of voice especially).¬†I was blown away once again by Al Pacino‚Äôs performance, which was even better than in the first movie. It‚Äôs flawless.¬†The final close-up on Michael‚Äôs face was the icing on the cake, showing how power can destroy anyone, and that he didn‚Äôt become the man his father dreamed he would be. It truly is one of the greatest films ever produced. 
3127 i could say "he's so hot and insane and violent i want to fuuuuck him" and you'd have no idea which one i'm talking about 
3128  Almost completely freed from the conventions of modern cinema, Francis Ford Coppola celebrates for the second time the career of Michael Corleone, once thought up by Mario Puzo, which he has since expanded into a complex biography and an ethic painting of several eras.Staged calmly and broadly, Coppola always finds the right images and undertones for the melancholy from which his second part of the "Godfather" saga is knitted: It is more meandering than at the beginning, the story‚Ä¶

Often cited as one of the greatest films ever, winning 6 academy awards, and boasting a star-studded cast; such a line up of positives are certain to make for a disappointment in any other situation. But not here. The Godfather part II manages to live up to its name, and excel in every area possible. Along with part I, this‚Ä¶

3131 the way how the cuts and transitions from vito to michael are all satisfyingly fitting, coherent, and well-founded makes me consider that this is actually better and more artistically thought-out than the first one, given that this film's last minutes reeks of indubitably much more poignancy. 
3132  Oh here we go, I finally make a long awaited return to a film that I admired more than I loved, but found: One, that I still feel the same towards it as a viewing experience; Two, my appreciation of it though has deepened.Where my appreciation deepens more than ever is Al Pacino‚Äôs towering, formidable performance as Michael Corleone who has inherited the family‚Äôs power. On the day of his son‚Äôs First Communion party, an assassination attempt with machine‚Ä¶  
3133 The most amazing thing to me is how the scope is so drastically expanded over the first movie, and yet the spirit is 100% consistent. Nothing is out of character, nothing is missing. Perfect.

3138  My 500th film on letterboxd!!Surprisingly underwhelmed and a little bored by this. I guess I just expected this sequel to maintain the same quick pace as the first with just as much action, but this movie is way more character based than part 1. This isn‚Äôt to say that The Godfather Part 2 isn‚Äôt brilliant, it certainly is. It‚Äôs just that it throws everything that made the first Godfather so great out the window, and tries a completely different‚Ä¶

3140 The Godfather was great but this sequel is the superior movie in my opinion. Coppola effortlessly switches between past and present, showing us Vito Corleone's origin story and Michael Corleone trying to expand his empire. I'm actually kind of shocked how little De Niro is in this. All his scenes were great however.I had fabulous time watching this with Michelle. Looking forward to watching the incest one. 
3141 Michael Corleone let me suck your dick 
3142 my main takeaway from this one is that being in the mafia is awesome. 
3143  As read in the history books, DP Gordon Willis was of course recognized for his groundbreaking work on the two Godfather films, winning best cinematography for- oh wait, he wasn‚Äôt even nominated and The Towering Inferno won instead.¬†He would further change cinema with more collaborations with Diane Keaton, lighting up the screen with Annie Hall, Interiors and the most iconic New York movie¬†Manhattan, but it‚Äôs like really guys, not even a nomination?¬†The Academy is basically Hyman Roth here.

3144 The contrapuntal editing of the iconic baptismal in the first part is sustained, expanded, and deepened for 200 minutes. One of the few times Coppola was allowed to bring all his talents to bear on a scale and with the autonomy commensurate with his aspirations.Pacino‚Äôs work is simply one of the finest performances put to film, especially when one considers how inert, remote, and flat out boring this arc could be in the hands of another performer. It‚Äôs a testament to the harmony between actor, director, and material that Michael remains compelling as he descends deeper into impenetrability. 
3145 young robert de niro in this just hits different 
3146  I don't feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom. Just my enemies. The Godfather Part II did not live up to the lofty expectations I had put on it after hearing it was one of the few sequels to surpass the original (Empire Strikes Back, Judgement Day, Dark Knight, etc). It was definitely very good and I enjoyed it, just not a masterpiece on par with the original.While Pacino as Michael is excellent again (SO in control and‚Ä¶  
3147  Much like the prior film, so much has been written about this film and the masterpiece that it is. I‚Äôll add just a few little sentences to add to the growing legacy of this film being quite possibly better then the original.¬†For one, Al Pacino delivers THE greatest acting performance of all time. Subtle, volatile, calculating, Michael Corleone gets to continue one of the great character arcs only rivaled, in my opinion, by the journey of Walter White in¬†Breaking‚Ä¶  
3148  The Godfather Part 2 is without a doubt one of the greatest sequels to have ever been made and just like the first one, it‚Äôs one of the best mafia films of all time.¬†A sequel to The Godfather was not very necessary as it ended so perfectly and living up to the sky-high expectations set by the first film would have been incredibly difficult but The Godfather Part 2 not only serves as a terrific sequel but also a‚Ä¶  
3149  An epic and fitting sequel which is slightly better than it's predecessor.The performances, the direction, the production design, the score, the attention to details, the dialogues, the screenplay, the cinematography and the execution of all these aspects cohesively makes this movie a masterpiece and one of my favorite films of all time.I can't go into the details of every aspect cause everything that has to be said has already been said a countless times, this one is peak‚Ä¶  
3150 I wish I loved this, but I just don‚Äôt. Interest is a huge part when watching a film. There were a lot of scenes where I drifted off because I just couldn‚Äôt get into it. I do agree that this film is great on technical aspects though, so I definitely respect it for that. Part 2 isn‚Äôt nearly as good as Part 1, but I still liked it

3153 Ever since I saw The Godfather in the cinema for its 50th anniversary, I'd been thinking about how I didn't want to miss the same celebration for Part II.

3156  5/5English: Absolutely extraordinary. The transition between Vito and Michael and how different they are, Vito was loyal to family while Michael was loyal to business is just tragic!The acting is phenomenal, the music is majestic and the story just keep your eyes on the screen the whole runtime. Those 3h and 22 minutes barely felt for me to be honest.Truly a masterpiece. I don't think is better than the first one but I don't think is worse.‚Ä¶

3158  The first Godfather saw Michael Corleone‚Äôs transition from ‚Äúordinary‚Äù man to the Don of the mafia. Part II is a continuation of his journey on a downward spiral.

3167  First review: letterboxd.com/thommy1801/film/the-godfather-part-ii/70s Francis Ford Coppola really was on another level than everyone else.

3171  Even though The Godfather Part 2 doesn‚Äôt star Marlon Brando, it‚Äôs still gives the first one a run for it‚Äôs money. It‚Äôs a very rare occurrence that the sequel is on par or even better then the first. Coppola absolutely nailed it with this.

3172  It ain‚Äôt that easy to make a sequel to a masterpiece, but Godfather 2 successfully accomplishes the feat with high standards. The movie acts as both a prequel & sequel to its predecessor, alternating between two timelines showcasing the early life of Vito Corleone and the journey of Michael Corleone into a powerful Don.

3176 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   BROVEMBER 29/30"The Godfather: Part II" is an incredible movie, but to me, it's no "The Godfather." Chronicling the dark descent Michael Corleone continues on as the new Don, as well as give us flashbacks to the rise of Vito Corleone, "The Godfather: Part II" is a great logical sequel that builds upon the world of betrayals, family feuds, and absolute power absolutely corrupting from the first film. Al Pacino kills it in the role with his character no longer‚Ä¶   
3177  [74]Third full viewing (I think), and how the tables have finally turned. Score down from 82 (and at one point before I started using Letterboxd, I'd have considered this a 5-star film); still think it's pretty great, but the older and more learned I get, the more its flaws become apparent to me. This time, I kept thinking about how awesome a three (or even two-and-a-half) hour "prequel only" would've been, keeping the entire events of the film contained‚Ä¶  
3178  The Godfather: Part II is impressive in that it often stands up right beside the first film on ‚Äúgreatest of all time‚Äù lists. I‚Äôve heard many even place it above the first film.While I certainly agree it is a quality film, I personally didn‚Äôt enjoy it as much as the first. Really, this is for two reasons.#1: I don‚Äôt find Michael as compelling of a ‚Äúmob boss‚Äù type figure as I did Vito in the first film. I‚Ä¶  
3179  One of the greatest movies ever made, etc etc. We all know this and there‚Äôs no need to rehash it.I wanna focus on one thing in this write-up: Al Pacino, who in my opinion, gives the single greatest performance in a movie ever. While everyone enjoys a character on the upswing, ascending to power (Godfather Part 1), it‚Äôs usually the fall from grace that‚Äôs more engaging...as demonstrated by Al‚Äôs bravura take on Michael‚Äôs character arc in this film. He‚Äôs‚Ä¶  
3180 96Just like its predecessor, I think Part II starts off brilliantly, has a perfect 1st act, slows down *way* too much in the middle, then ends on a powerful high note that leaves me pondering.I can talk for hours about Coppola's brilliance with the framing, the lighting, the blocking, and his repurposing of certain images and symbols to drive further home the themes of cycles of violence and toxic masculinity. 
3181 do i think this franchise is a masterpiece? no i do notdo i respect the conquered themes, acting and expansiveness of the plot and scenery? yes i doi get why people love these, i just don't 
3182 I'll probably be the only Godfather Part II fan to have seen Part I over 10 times, including in a cinema, and still give it a middling 8/10. It's good, sometimes great, but mostly a prelude to Coppola's masterpiece. It's here, where the themes of an immigrant story, the American Dream, and capitalism resonate with me the most. Maybe I'd enjoy them better the other way around, with Part I as more of a prequel to Michael's story instead. I'm being very facetious either way. 
3183 "They're saps cause they fight for strangers."What makes "The Godfather Part II" so amazing really is that it is all emotion, just like Coppola's best films, and really shows that the reason movies exist is to make you feel something, and this whole film is feeling. Michael's descent and Vito's rise are complimentary as an allegory for what the American Dream is and how violence corrupts. Coppola is a grand master of cinema and is one of the living legends and one of the greatest geniuses of our time. 
3184 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   in the godfather, michael's separateness from the family means the story is framed as his corruption. in this movie, that's questioned: his separateness from the family means he doesn't have the same deeply felt connection to the same values as vito. vito acted with a greater purpose: family and community, michael acts only with the selfish interests of himself in mind. this comes to a head in the final time distorting cuts. 1941 michael left alone in the dining room‚Ä¶   
3185  Rewatching the film I was simultaneously missing all the iconic elements of the first film, while also being supremely impressed by how the film really doesn't lose a step even with Caan's and Brando's presence gone. Fredo's role is beefed up, which is perfect since John Cazale gets a far better opportunity to shine, crafting an amazing sap out of his character. Most of all though I was taken by the contrast created between Michael's present story and Vito's youth,‚Ä¶

3189 My favorite movie and another stone cold classic! The direction, music, cinematography and acting are all top notch. The story intertwines two tales in a fascinating way. It's the rise (and fall) of an empire. A perfect movie.I love it more than the original, which shouldn't be possible. Just a master class in every avenue of film making. 
3190  A very worthy successor and another splendid film from Francis Ford Coppola. Seeing young Vito Corleone and the start of his empire was really interesting. I liked the way the film constantly juxtaposes flashbacks of his early years with the present time. It also focuses on Michael, who is now head of the family and has to deal with the responsabilities and risks of being in that position. There were many suspenseful and shocking scenes, but also some fine emotional‚Ä¶  
3191  ‚ÄúThis is the business we‚Äôve chosen!‚ÄùI continue to marvel at the genius of Coppola's narrative structure: its braiding of sequel with prequel using techniques taken from the Modernist novel and owing more to Joseph Conrad than classic Hollywood screenwriters. He strings the story using critical family rituals like beads on a necklace: the sacraments of burial and First Communion, New Years Eve, the Feast of San Gennaro, Palm Sunday, a wake, and a surprise birthday party.The future is‚Ä¶  
3192 3.5 hours of young al pacino & robert de niro‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. this is what cinema is all about 
3193 I do love Godfather II and consider it a classic, but ultimately I prefer Part I. I find watching Michael's ascension to power to be more compelling than just seeing him at the top. Plus, Part I's got all the iconic scenes with Brando and the rest of cast.¬†Both films are great though and complement each other like one big film.

3198  Short ReviewAdded to: Francis Ford Coppola RankedA huge improvement on the already solid first chapter of the Godfather saga, The Godfather Part II is in many ways its predecessor and more.

3199  After watching The Godfather for the first time last week, the logical next step would of course be to watch The Godfather: Part II given how it is widely regarded as the greatest sequel of all time and one which many would even say surpasses the original. I, however, would not say that this is a better film than the first though it does run it awfully close since this is undoubtedly one of the great tragic cinematic tales ever‚Ä¶

The perfect sequel which did the impossible and surpassed the original in terms of ambition and quality, this, at times is almost hypnotic in the way it demands your attention. With two parallel stories acting as both a sequel and a prequel, we get the best of both worlds as Pacino and De Niro hook us with stories encompassing two generations of the Corleone Family. Riveting, compelling, timeless.

3205  The most important implication that The Godfather: Part II poses is that the competition of who's hotter between young Pacino and young De Niro is not as clear as it may have seemed. De Niro really takes stride in the handsomeness and smoothness categories in his portrayal of young Vito. Had just a mediocre time watching this masterpiece on 35mm at the Prospect Park Nighthawk Theater. I guess this godfather part 2 review is as good of a time as‚Ä¶  
3206 Sublime to see it on the big screen at last, after having known it like a Bible text by heart since age 16 but not having seen it since then. Very elemental like a child‚Äôs fable, very Griffith: father/son, man/woman, Miami/Cuba, Vegas/NYC, calm/shout, brown/red, earth/water. Michael V Gazzo MVP ‚Äî that kind of performance interests me greatly nowadays, and you don‚Äôt see much of it, really. Good LORD, the blocking‚Äîthose blurry empty chunks of the screen speak volumes. And about 79 other things I jotted down, all of greater importance than what I sloppily suggest above. 
3207 the end dinner scene makes me so emotional it‚Äôs just so perfect 
3208  My father taught me many things here - he taught me in this room. He taught me: keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. -Michael CorleoneI don‚Äôt care how many times I watch this movie, over how many decades I‚Äôm still in awe of it. You‚Äôre not supposed to be able to catch lightening in a bottle twice, but they did. They took what is masterpiece, made a sequel to it and not only did it turn out‚Ä¶  
3209 An incredible, flawless masterpiece worthy of its gargantuan reputation. That being said, it still can‚Äôt help but live in the shadow of the strongest entry in this series ‚ÄúScooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed‚Äù, Coppola just seemingly can‚Äôt help to try his damnest to imitate the stylistic flourishes seen in Raja Gosnell‚Äôs epic Doo Duology and it SHOWS. But it‚Äôs best I judge this film on its own merits and not compare it, for it just goes to show the influence Scooby-Doo 2 was able to have even 28 years before its release. Hot take: this is a damn fine picture! 
3210 An emotionally deep sequel that's more expansive in scope then the first one with two stories taking place in two different time frames. It's a story that talks about greed, capitalism, trust, legacy amd family. It's a film that explores thebcorleone family and the beginning juxtaposed with the end and undoing of the corleone family It's big, well acted,looks amazing and is very dramatic, it sags a bit in the middle but overall its a briliant sequel. 
3211  Watching both in the same day has made me realise that this is better than the first and possibly the greatest movie ever made. It's more complex and complicated narrative works wonders, presenting deeper themes and conflicts, flawlessy blending two excellent storylines and showing the rise and downfall of the family without fault.The acting performances somehow get even better from its predecessor. This might be a very unpopular opinion but I honestly believe that Robert De Niro plays Vito‚Ä¶  
3212 ‚ÄúBut you can never lose your family.‚ÄùVito as a young man is arguably my favourite story in all of movie history. Watching him lose his entire family only to rebuild it in the new world is so compelling, particularly when it‚Äôs juxtaposed with Michaels unintentional destruction of everything his father created.Side Note: Is it just me or was young Mama Corleone looking hot? No? Just me? Think I‚Äôve seen this movie way too many times. 
3213  Looking back on my movie diary it has been almost five years since I saw this, possibly the greatest sequel ever made. During that time I've watched almost 3000 films, but hadn't returned to the Corleone saga until the missus popped it in on Thursday evening. Much has been made of whether the second chapter of this Italian/American crime family drama is even better than Coppola's original film. Some like the De Niro factor that appears here, others prefer Brando's‚Ä¶  
3214  Holy shit!! I did it! Not only did I finish my recommendations list but I also hit 365 films this year! I know it‚Äôs not a super big deal for some but between a new job and a move, it was really hard for me. So yeah I feel a little proud of myself. Anyway I‚Äôll probably be taking a small break from reviews and be hitting some comfort rewatches.¬†Onto the review:Big shift in tone from the first‚Ä¶  
3215 First one is far better but this is no doubt entertaining. One of the best movies of all time? Yeah, I don‚Äôt think so. It‚Äôs a fine movie with a thrilling mob plot but it doesn‚Äôt do anything all that crazy or new to warrant such a title. 
3216 . 
3217 ‚ÄúIf anything in this life is certain -- If history has taught us anything -- It‚Äôs that you can kill anybody.‚ÄùSuch a remarkable, well-balanced prequel/sequel that‚Äôs beyond words. An intricately crafted story of the rise and fall of power where¬†Al Pacino and Robert De Niro¬†are just on another level.The Godfather: Part II excels at displaying the similitudes of father and son conducting mafia business as well as the ways it alters their families. A thrilling and sweeping epic that wholly flies by; I think I finally understand the hype. 
3218 This was fan-fucking-tastic 
3219 Francis Ford Coppola is a master of his craft and he proved it again with this timeless masterpiece. Hands down the longest and the most taxing film I've ever watched. I need to sleep on it tonight but all I can say is that, this film deserves every single praise and hype it gotten as much as its predecessor.My final take : The Godfather > The Godfather 2 
3220 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Major Spoilers Ahead!¬†The Godfather Part II is the greatest sequel ever made. The film lives up to the original in every way. The acting is superb again. Al Pacino is great again, it‚Äôs a true shame that the Oscars didn‚Äôt give him a best actor Oscar.¬†Robert De Niro and John Cazale do phenomenally¬†in their roles as Vito and Fredo also. De Niro lived up to Marlon Brando and played Vito perfectly. John did great as Fredo also, he perfectly‚Ä¶   
3221  after over a year since i first saw the first installment in the corleone legacy, i finally watched The Godfather Part II.the sheer scope of this thing makes it hard to talk about, it's an incredibly overwhelming experience the first time around.i don't want to talk about it just yet because i know i'll sound dumb (just like the people i complain about constantly whenever i rewatch the first film), but i'll rewatch it within the next couple‚Ä¶

3225  Junior and senior year of high school was the time when I was obsessed with Al Pacino. I saw Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon, Cruising, Sea of Love, Carlito‚Äôs Way, Heat, etc. all in an effort to become this man. I took acting both those years (never thought I‚Äôd have the guts to act with classmates but I went fuck it mode), and basically dreamed of being Michael Corleone.After seeing this and its predecessor a couple dozen of times (saw‚Ä¶  
3226 Michael Corleone don't hold a grudge challenge!Just as good as the first, Al Pacino is my biggest crush, Bobby De Niro speaking Italian is beautiful, and of course this film is pure genius. I think I'll finally watch part III soon. 
3227  okay okay. now this one. this gave me exactly what i needed. i definitely prefer this over the first on almost every point except perhaps michael since he‚Äôs simply maintained one of the best parts throughout the series. i think i kinda love u al pacino in this era‚Ä¶. one of my favorite parts of the first movie was michael‚Äôs arc, and this one only furthering that & leading to how much deeper he goes in this one was so well‚Ä¶  
3228  Funny how some people love these movies because "It has cool gangsters" when The Godfather & The Godfather Part 2 are really tragic & heartbreaking.Michael maintains his power but loses his family & any shred of humanity left in him which is perfectly contrasted by Vito's origins story which starts with him losing his family but eventually rebuilding it while gaining power at the same time. I do feel that the portion of the movie set in Havana felt somewhat dragged out‚Ä¶

3232  Revisiting "The Godfather: Part II" ‚Äì An Unforgettable Cinematic JourneyI recently finished watching "The Godfather: Part II" again, and let me tell you, it's a movie that doesn't just stand the test of time ‚Äì it thrives in it. From the very first frame, I was drawn right back into the world of power, family, and complex characters that made the first film a masterpiece. And let me say, this sequel doesn't disappoint.One thing that struck me was‚Ä¶  
3233  ‚ÄúTell me something, Ma. What did Papa think, deep in his heart?‚Äùthat's it, that's my favorite quote from all the godfather movies. I think Michael is one of the most interesting and dissectable characters I've seen in a while. I think that's why I watch the godfather so much because you'll never be able to understand his arc fully but it's fun to try, it's fun to try and pick up new things. This quote is probably the most‚Ä¶  
3234 ‚ÄúEvery time I put the line in the water I said a Hail Mary and every time I said a Hail Mary I caught a fish‚Äù.Incredible performance by one of the greatest of all time, John Cazale ‚ù§Ô∏è 
3235 Coppola on te m√©rite pas mon gars 
3236  Sorry to all the people who think the first one is better (it's still great ofc, and I sincerely do mean that), but the quality of Part II compared to Part I goes ‚¨ÜZOOOOOOOOMMMMM‚¨Ü!!! There's so much more to chew on here. The script was so engaging and beautifully complex (like a REALLY good game of chess). The characters were far more fleshed out here, especially Vito and Michael. I loved seeing the differences and similarities between father and son.‚Ä¶  
3237 I only recently watched The Godfather for the first time about 6 months ago. When a movie has been talked up and hyped up so much, it can be really hard for the film to live up to those lofty expectations. The Godfather certainly met those expectations. Having had that experience essentially raised my expectations for¬†The Godfather Part II even further. And yet‚Ä¶.I was still blown away by this movie. Not much I can say that hasn‚Äôt been said about this film. Masterpiece. ¬†Period.¬†Degrees of Kevin Bacon: 1Robert De Niro and Kevin Bacon in Sleepers 
3238 You broke my heart.*Makes out with you violently* 
3239  Now there is a vocal group of people who rate The Godfather Part II higher than the first, and I can see why. The direction and storytelling of this movie felt more ambitious and accomplished even more in its scale than the first of the trilogy; however, I just did not find The Godfather Part II very entertaining.The dialogue in this film was incredible and Al Pacino really started coming into his own here, but in terms of suspense,‚Ä¶  
3240  I've been calling The Godfather Part II my favourite movie for the last few years and that opinion isn't budging. Finally seeing the film in a movie theater has only deepened my fanaticism. I suppose a small part of me does wish I could pick something a little more odd and offbeat, not a lionized classic widely loved by virtually everyone from hardcore cinephiles to casual moviegoers. But I'd rather be honest than cool. The fact is, no movie's story‚Ä¶  
3241 ohhhhhhh now I get why this one is called part two 
3242 It was a mental game of chess between Michael and Roth. The pawns are usually the first to be eliminated, but Fredo was able to make it til the end 
3243  The Godfather Part 2 is not only the best sequel of all times, it's pretty much the second best movie ever made. A fantastic epic from minute 1 to minute 202.¬†6th place of my favorite movies and although it is the best sequel, I think the prequel scenes are the best. De Niro plays probably his best role and for me the best supporting role ever. And while we're on the subject of performances, it's also worth mentioning that‚Ä¶  
3244 Honestly pretty underwhelming, and nothing like my favourite gangster film of all time (Gotti). For some reason, they cast brilliant comedic actor Robert DeNiro (Meet the Fockers, Dirty Grandpa) in a dramatic role and it just doesn't work at all. 
3245 Best Fan Service ever.

I maintain, having seen it only last year that it is endlessly rewatchable, quotable and possibly the most iconic film ever made. However, this evening I rewatched The Godfather Part 2, for the first time in a while. And it isn't without those‚Ä¶

3254  It's better. Took two close watches to unpack such a dense film, but I finally believe the hype. Gone is the warmth, gone is the fun, gone is the family, and all your left with is a subtle downward spiral. You have two contrasting stories that feed into each other perfectly.

You broke my heart!‚ÄùIf you thought my some of my opinions about the original Godfather were pretty hot, The Godfather Part II has to be one of my hottest takes yet. This movie is loved, it has one of the highest rating on Letterboxd and I can‚Äôt understand how or why. I started watching‚Ä¶  
3256  My father's name was Antonio Andolini... and this is for you.Here it is: the mother of all sequels (and prequels). The movie that some claim to be the best of all-time. I‚Äôve finally watched it, and wow, was it electric.While this film continues the story of Michael Corleone‚Äôs reign as the Don and the ever-growing gambling empire he‚Äôs inherited, this film also examines the rise of his father Vito Corleone through flashback, and how a man who‚Äôs lost‚Ä¶  
3257 This sequel, that also served as a prequel, is definitely & inarguably one of the best. But, wow, this this time ¬†and compared to the 1st part, Godfather Part II just wrecked my emotions big time! 
3258  I'm sure to some the idea of following up The Godfather - which many consider the pinnacle of cinema - was not a wise one. But when The Godfather: Part II finally revealed itself to audiences worldwide on December 20th 1974, most - if not all - were truly mesmerized by it.This was not just some sequel. This was a sequel with brains. A sequel that was just as - if not more - brilliant than its predecessor. It‚Ä¶  
3259  ‚ÄúI don't feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom. Just my enemies.‚ÄùAlthough I ended up not liking the second part of¬†The Godfather as much as the first I have to say that this is still a perfect film. For me it doesn‚Äôt quite hit the 5 star mark though just because the story in this one didn‚Äôt interest to the same extent. Michael‚Äôs character arc in the first is amazing and was a huge reason why I loved‚Ä¶  
3260  The first is unquestionably more iconic and more quotable as well, but for me the second surpasses it as the better movie overall. Whilst Marlon Brando‚Äôs presence and demeanour as the Godfather is undoubtedly missed, the origin story behind Vito Corleone portrayed by Robert De Niro was also fantastic in its own way with countless scenes showcasing his ruthless rise to top.¬†It‚Äôs really complicated to quantify greatness when comparing completely different roles however I believe Al Pacino‚Äôs performance assuming‚Ä¶  
3261  "ICH WEISS DASS DU ES WARST, FREDO!"Wer auch nur im Ansatz der Meinung sei, DER PATE TEIL I w√ºrde stellenweise den Gangstermythos prosaisch romantisieren und verharmlosen, glaubt entweder noch an den Weihnachtsmann mit seinem dicken Sack und langer Rute, oder an den Osterhasen der irgendwelche Eier bunt anpinselt.Und selbst wenn DER PATE TEIL I in Ans√§tzen den Gangstermythos romatisieren w√ºrde, so nur dann um diesen sp√§testens in TEIL II komplett niederzureissen. Genau dies geschieht hier, zwar langsam und‚Ä¶  
3262  Just like the first one, this is beautifully crafted, a true masterclass on filmmaking, but the story just doesn't do it for me.I don't know what it is, but the storytelling doesn't feel as strong as the previous film and just in general it's not as interesting, although a lot more happens it all ends up being all over the place and with this one you can actually feel the runtime, I still liked it, so I don't know‚Ä¶  
3263 Peak Holiday viewing with the parents: enduring 425 commercial breaks (all with essentially the same 6-8 ads running In slightly different order) between watching 5-7 min incremental moments of this classic sequel on a streaming service that cut out all the violence. That it was still mesmerizing through all that clutter is a testament to a masterpiece.¬†Hey, at least the motion smoothing wasn‚Äôt on! 
3264  So damn breathtaking at every moment, more grand and poetic than the first, and even slower as this substitutes Part I's somewhat taut and """""simple""""" narrative for a calmer and episodic one, making so much of this honestly hard to follow. Every watch honestly feels like my first one. The world is rich on a surface level, but even richer underneath through what the characters don't even say or even what they suggest through one line of dialogue. It eventually‚Ä¶  
3265  I would rank this below the first. The subplot with the Rosato brothers is under-developed and the film loses a lot of steam in the second half with the Senate hearings, Michael having nothing else to do, and Frank being stuck in the army barracks. It's not quite as good as the first. I think my favorite parts of the movie are with Vito, and not only because it perfectly parallels Michael's attempts to run the family business and it‚Ä¶  
3266 MICHAEL COR FUCKING LEONE! üêê It was a blessing that I waited this long to see Part 2 as well as 1 especially with a 4K transfer. A true cinematic marvel. What a story! Part 2 was definitely my favourite. PURE PERFECTION. I now see why this is one of the highest rated films of all time. A timeless masterpiece. 
3267 Al Pacino is phenomenal in this; it‚Äôs amazing to see how his character evolves throughout the first two films. It‚Äôs difficult for me to pick which of the two I like more because Al Pacino is incredible in this, but I also loved Marlon Brando in the first Godfather. As a huge Rocky fan, it‚Äôs very interesting to see how Talia Shire & Joe Spinell are in this series as well. It‚Äôs crazy they were part of two iconic film series

3271 and one taught me pain 
3272  don't ever make the mistake i made: apathetically choose to watch the godfather epic just because it was the only one available to stream. continuity is vital to the expression of this film: the rise of the father, vito corleone, and the fall of his son, michael. if he's Italian -- why does he bother other Italians?you try and find your way in to make it a duality, try and find parallels between the father and the son, but‚Ä¶

3276 This has to be easily one of the best paced 3+ hours films ever. Young De Niro makes for a well convincing Vito Corleone, meanwhile Al still gives everything for Michael's eventual downfall.I can't compare if Part 1 or 2 are better, but each one is amazing in its own right. 
3277  At a loss for words. Not only because it seems absolutely everything that needed to be said, has already been said about this film, but also because I am pretty stunned. I genuinely can‚Äôt think of something even slightly coherent to say. I don‚Äôt feel the need to say that I‚Äôm over exaggerating here because I‚Äôm sure everything I have to say about this masterwork has been uttered by many, plenty and plenty of times.There‚Äôs before you watch The‚Ä¶

3279 Vito is an ENTJ and Michael is definitely an INTJ. 
3280  I know it was you, Fredo.The juxtaposition between the rise of Vito Corleone and the fall of the good man that Michael Corleone might have been is elegantly laid out as the timeline jumps back and forth between the two stories over the course of the film. But it's drawn into sharp focus only in the final scene of the film, a flashback that sees Michael and the whole Corleone clan awaiting the arrival of their father. Michael announces‚Ä¶  
3281 "times are changing" from the family to the exchequer 
3282 leave the knife, take the olive oil; plenty of superlatives to throw at this on a given day, and I‚Äôll stand by it being better than its predecessor, but it really hit me this time (after not watching it in over a decade) how much more theatrical it feels compared to the crime conventions of the first film ‚Äî the new hollywood equivalent of slow cinema 
3283 Darker, bleaker, more thematically complex than its predecessor‚Äîwhich also means it's something of a bummer, as we witness the ruin created by a lifetime of evil works. Coppola presents a potent depiction of a growing generational divide, exemplified by the scene where Michael goes to his mother for guidance and we realize there's a gulf between their ways of thinking that will never be crossed, and the opulent production values are a leap forward from the relatively gritty original. But while I appreciate this sequel intellectually, I don't feel it in my bones like the first film. 
3284  I've been watching movies but haven't done any reviews or logged any films yet. I will see if I can catch up but I don't know if any of the reviews will be very long. I was going to watch a different movie on Paramount Plus but ended up watching this one when I noticed it was back on my watchlist there. The nice thing about Paramount Plus is it will add a movie back to that list if it‚Ä¶  
3285  The Great Debate, The Godfather or The Godfather pt II? I honestly have never felt it was really a debate, sure I give them both 5 stars and both are 10/10 movies.

Marlon Brando and James Caan are impossible to replace, so while the addition of De Niro is great, it just not enough to make up for missing‚Ä¶

We find ourselves following both Vito Corleone‚Äôs rise to power and Michael Corleone‚Äôs fall from grace, with the two plotlines effortlessly contrasting each other. Vito‚Äôs good will and empathy for the common man is what allows him to rise in power from his humble beginnings. While his crime empire is no doubt an immoral venture, his diligence with his work and passion for his family is what keeps him going.‚Ä¶

3302 Simply a masterpiece! Even better than Part I and probably the best sequel I have ever seen.I love how the story is told in two different timelines that complement each other perfectly. The flashbacks brilliantly expand the family saga and impressively show the tragedy that is unfolding on Michael's way up.For me personally The Godfather Part II is the best Mafia film of all time. 
3303  Roughly a month ago, I revisited The Godfather for the first time in half of my life, about 14 or 15 years. I always knew it was a brilliant film, but it took me seeing it again to truly understand it's wonders, the artistry of the film making.

It's a complete film in its own right.Three and a half hours all but flew by as‚Ä¶  
3307  No film has ever been more in love with its subject than The Godfather Part II is with Robert De Niro as Vito Corleone. The thesis of the movie is that Vito is cool and hot, while Michael is a punk bitch. Made up like a silent movie star, De Niro struts around the wonderfully artificial street(s) of depression-era New York like a mythic folk hero. Of course it creates a horrifically tragic parallel to the very tactile, ugly world‚Ä¶

3329  We‚Äôre bigger than U.S Steel. Much bigger. Godfather 2 engulfs all of cinema, its largeness equaled only by the film that came before it. It doubles down on greatness both literally and figuratively, pairing the already imperious Al Pacino with Robert De Niro. Father and son. American and Italian. Icon and icon. It is an immigrant story, charting Vito Corleone‚Äôs (De Niro) rise to power. But it is also a sprawling drama of generational trauma, tracing his son, Michael Corleone‚Äôs‚Ä¶

3334 Es perfecta, majestuosa, fant√°stica, sorprendente, impactante, impecable en todos los aspectos posibles. Dura 3 horas y media y literalmente se te pasa volando y nunca te aburr√≠s, sent√≠ que la escena inicial con el joven Vito la hab√≠a visto hace como 1 horita...aunque prefiera la primera por bastante (sobretodo por Marlon Brando), esta es una secuela igual de perfecta que su antecesora. 
3335 Es f√§llt wirklich nicht schwer zu behaupten, dass The Godfather II das wohl beste Sequel der Filmgeschichte ist. Ich kann mich nicht erinnern, dass es irgendein Film davor oder danach geschafft hat eine Vorgeschichte und ein Sequel gleichzeitig in dieser Qualit√§t zu erz√§hlen. Performances, Bilder, Musik, Geschichte. Alles am Rande der Perfektion. Im Prinzip auf einer Stufe mit dem Vorg√§nger. In mir hat lediglich die Figur um Vito im Vorg√§nger mehr Interesse geweckt. Also in meinem Ranking knapp hinter dem ersten Godfather. 
3336  Paramount. Coppola Restoration Blu-Ray1.85:1Color35mm18‚ÄúYou broke my heart. You broke my heart!‚ÄùSECOND VIEWING¬†Coppola‚Äôs sequel/prequel is the definition of outstanding. It stands as a sequel, a prequel, and if you really want, it can also be viewed as a standalone feature.

The idea to layer and mirror the past, present and future with Vito‚Äôs and Michael‚Äôs separate rise to power‚Ä¶  
3337  Is it weird to call The Godfather Part II a horror movie?Francis Ford Coppola approaches this sequel with the upmost respect and sincerity. From the casting of Robert De Niro as a younger Vito Corleone to the brilliant characterisation, and juxtaposition, of his son, Michael.¬†What terrifies me the most about both Part II and it's predecessor, is it's construction of Michael, played brilliantly by Al Pacino.

3339  Pretty incredible movie. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs as good as the original though ‚Äî the screenplay isn‚Äôt as tight, pacing isn‚Äôt as good and it misses that spark that was brought by Marlon Brandos performance as vito. Never the less, a incredible sequel.Vito was a loving and calm man where family was his first priority, whilst Michael is more angry, unhinged and cares about business over anything else. So the vibe is very different between the two films! I‚Ä¶  
3340  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom. Just my enemies.‚ÄùThe Godfather: Part II is a movie of parallels. Past and present. Father and son. Family and business. A fight against power and a fight to maintain it. It has a dual plot structure unrelated in story but thematically highlighting the tragedy of change.Compared to the first one, this feels more ambitious, just like Michael‚Äôs new intentions. Three and a half hours is nothing to scoff‚Ä¶  
3341  You think Rian Johnson subverts expectations? Let me tell you about my boy Francis...The first Godfather is about the improbable rise of Michael Corleone, the easy-to-cheer-for World War 2 soldier whose hand is forced into the family business after his older brother is brutally murdered and his father passes away. The movie ends with Michael righting some wrongs and dabbling into a little bit of evil as he orders the death of his treacherous brother-in-law‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ask me about‚Ä¶  
3342 Far and away the most overrated movie I‚Äôve ever seen. I know this is a very hot take but this has never clicked with me.¬†Why does this story exist? What happens in this film that doesn‚Äôt happen in the second half of part 1? I‚Äôm so bored with this film because it feels redundant. We see Micheal become EVEN MORE of a monster? Okay. For 2.5 hours? Gets a lil stale. Still shot well. The acting especially De Niro, and especially not Pacino, is pretty good. Overall though, a unnecessary and mediocre film. 
3343 Films Watched in 2022¬†- Film 377I‚Äôm glad I rewatched this because I barely remembered any of it. It‚Äôs very different from the first and I still feel like I‚Äômmissing something to be honest.Somewhere between a 3.5 and a 4. Had it at a 4 but slept on it and felt nothing towards it really. 
3344  If the original Godfather is the ascension of Michael Corleone to stop the passing of the ages, the sequel is Michael's final commitment to power, and all of its terrible costs. When absolute power corrupts absolutely, what remains for those on the throne? Power's great price, isolation, originates deep in the heart of those Machiavellians who would harden their hearts beyond all redemption, to control all humans by force, lucre, and menace. Without a single passage into their vulnerability, the‚Ä¶  
3345  Part I tells a complete story of one man's fall into corruption, but Part II is what transforms it into tragedy. It is a heavy, grandiose sprawl - we're still in the realm of opera, but if the first film is more like Puccini, depicting with grubby realism the effects of human cruelty and depravity on other humans, this one is Wagnerian, plunging us into a world that has already fallen, watching a man whose fate is preordained from before‚Ä¶

3347  The Godfather: Part II --- 1974Godfather: Part II is an ambitious movie. In many respects it might be just as ambitious as the first Godfather film and in fact it might be even more ambitious than the first in it's overall story arc.

3350 Better than the first imo, and that is saying something 
3351  Right off the bat I‚Äôm going to nip any comparison to the first in the bud. In terms of a singular viewing experience I‚Äôd say I prefer the first, but honestly the two films are so perfectly complimentary of each other that I find any kind of ‚Äúwhich is better‚Äù discussion entirely reductive.Michael Corleone‚Äôs journey is far more sprawling than Vito‚Äôs and we see from the very beginning that Michael is not Vito. He has scenes that reminisce scenes‚Ä¶  
3352 I mean, it was good, but it didn't subvert my expectations. 
3353  It's maybe the greatest sequel ever made, in that what's accomplished in The Godfather Part II builds from the legacy that was left behind by Vito Corleone at the end of the first film to give us a sense of the ways one's own rise to becoming the Don of the Corleone family affected their interactions with the people around themselves. In Vito's case, we see how his childhood in Sicily was always tied back to the Mafia - leading‚Ä¶

3356  To get the most pressing question out of the way first, between ‚ÄúThe Godfather‚Äù and its sequel, the original is unequivocally the better film. At least in my books. I get why some people favor Part II though. It‚Äôs broader and far more ambitious, dividing its running time not exactly equally but significantly between two timelines set half a century apart and diving much deeper into the exact nature of the criminal enterprises of the Corleone clan.

3364  Hot take? This was good. This was not great. The story is fascinating, the ingenious idea to show Michael‚Äôs attempt at becoming the don while simultaneously showing Vito‚Äôs rise is the perfect way to tell this story.

3372  Pretty incredible.Considering my lukewarm reaction to the first installment of the trilogy, let's just say I was surprised at how easily Part II gripped me. It's so well-paced that it feels like a 90 minute flick, and so well-shot that I'd endlessly praise the cinematography after viewing on a laptop. And there's not a weak link in terms of performances, but Al Pacino and John Cazale are marvelous in their roles. Sounds trite, I know, but this floored me.‚Ä¶

Of course it is fantastic. One more thing that stands out to me: The band at the beginning not knowing any Italian music, that is just pure Coppola genius in presenting a theme. 
3375 Got to be the perfect sequel. I can see why people struggle to decide if the 1st or 2nd one is better. Al Pacino is just brilliant as usual and De Niro had an almost impossible job playing Vito as well as Marlon Brando but he stepped in brilliantly. Only negative about this film was outside the main characters, some of the acting was diabolical. 
3376 The relationship between Michael and Fredo is just amazing and Robert de Niro as young Vito Corleone was terrific and he defiantly deserved that Oscar back in the 1970's.Overall amazing!! 
3377  The biggest disappointment I have with reviewing this film is that I recently watched part one and gave that film 5 stars yet this film is even better than part one. Does that mean part one isnt a 5 star movie? No, no i dont think so. I just think that this is one of the super rare examples of a film requiring more stars than we have available. Almost a film that really does set the bar for all‚Ä¶  
3378 Now this is how you make a sequel. 
3379 "A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man." - Vito Corleone, The Godfather 
3380  Honestly I was somewhat underwhelmed by this and I know there‚Äôs a large camp that professes this superior or better than the first. I find the first Godfather to be more atmospheric, better paced, and the performances even more remarkable. Also the ending is far more memorable and dynamic. This spends more of its time focused on the political side of organized crime and the business type meetings behind closed doors.The dialogue can tend to feel more like a‚Ä¶  
3381 Fuck it, 5 stars for "I know it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart. You broke my heart." And then the look after because that is one of my favorite cinematic moments of all time. 
3382 Please De Niro do a great performance again, I need it! We need it! 
3383 poor Fredo, he just wanted to catch a fish for Anthony 
3384  Al Pacino‚Äôs hair is fucking immaculate throughout all of Part II.Part II¬†is such a special film for me. I‚Äôm not gonna beat the dead horse that is this film‚Äôs universal acclaim, you‚Äôve heard it all before. There‚Äôs not one misplaced narrative stroke or compulsion of character in Part II, replicating the finely tuned balance of The Godfather¬†and committing to cracking these characters open, bleeding them profusely all over the film‚Äôs thorny canvas. This film is a monstrous, twisted affair‚Ä¶  
3385  Ok, I get why people say this is the best sequel. It adds multiple layers of texture to the original film, both showing Vito‚Äôs early years to expand on that character, and then showing Michael‚Äôs further workings in the underworld. It could be two separate films, both are so engrossing, but the switch back and forth doesn‚Äôt weaken either which is very impressive. Every time the perspective changes, I wanted to go back to the one I‚Äôd just left. Overall‚Ä¶  
3386 god al pacino‚Äôs voice is out of this world. it‚Äôs like a switch, he can yell and it‚Äôs scary (but also hot) and then he lowers it to a whisper. it becomes so delicate and sweet so anything he said before is out of your mind. you become mesmerized and it‚Äôs a beautiful ability that al has. 
3387 10TH TIME WHO ELSE IS SCARED.... 
3388 ‚ÄúI was heading to a golden land of opportunity, a land with a pioneering spirit which welcomed misfits like me - but I ended up in America instead.‚Äù 
3389 Strangely enough, I preferred this sequel to the Original thanks to the brilliant use of flashbacks regarding Don Corleone's youth perfectly echoing Michael's current struggling in maintaining his father's legacy. Much like the first one, beautiful cinematography and impeccable acting. 
3390 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  The first Godfather is unquestionably an epic, but even that word doesn't do the enormity of its sequel justice. It's fucking huge, and even when its leisurely pacing and nonstop darkness threaten to become cumbersome, the stark contrasts between Vito building an empire and Michael destroying it--I apologize in advance--pull you back in. Part II is far from casual viewing and plays like a descent into a very real emotional hell, but it's considered essential for a reason.

I was hoping a rewatch would change my mind like it did with the first one but unfortunately it'll have to settle for just being a great movie and not an all time great.I think for me the thing that lets it down is the prequel side of things which I neither needed nor cared for.

3397  The Godfather review hereRather than a straightforward continuation of its highly acclaimed predecessor, The Godfather: Part II mixes things up. The continuation is done but as a parallel juxtaposition of the central characters as both sequel AND prequel. I haven't said anything new, really. But it's that reason why I think this sequel is likely the best of its kind in cinema. Power earned for family v. Power inherited and blinded by the hunger for more. The Michael Corleone‚Ä¶

Yes, this is 4.5 stars and the other is 5, so at a glance there‚Äôs not much difference. But I strongly prefer the original to the sequel, mostly because of the storyline and overall script. Of course, there are moments I love here. The Fredo storyline is easily the best thing in‚Ä¶  
3400 everybody‚Äôs always like robert de niro shows up in part two!! but what they should really add is:a) he plays a young marlon brandob) he speaks Italian for the whole movie 
3401 "If history has taught us anything it's that you can kill anyone" I think the most iconic line in cinema history is "keep your friends close but your enemies closer" and Al delivers it with pure perfection as he does with every line in this film.This is the perfect gangsta story I can't imagine it any different the Corlione family defines the word "MAFIA" 
3402 Everything I said about the first film is equally applicable to this, the greatest sequel of all time. It's possibly a notch above, or maybe below, but regardless, it's too close to call. My vote is one notch above. YMMV, but I thoroughly respect either position. Sublime. 
3403  79/100(was a 62/100)When I referred to the first film as ‚Äúthe great American tragedy‚Äù, I was really talking about the first in conjunction with the second rather than just the first(maybe the third will fit into this, who knows). This is a film that‚Äôs revelatory in so many ways, but first and foremost in the depths of its anguish.

This is more of a testament to the first film‚Äôs insane greatness rather than a testament to Part II‚Äôs¬†slight shortcomings in comparison.

3408 Masterpiece: Part II. 
3409  Widely considered the best film of all time, I went into watching this believing it would be an easy 5 star rating. Much like the first Godfather movie, I found it to be too tiresome and overrated. Sure, there‚Äôs beautiful cinematography and strong acting performances, but its extended runtime and boring tone makes it a bit of a slogfest. There is definitely some notable scenes that are worthy of praise, but I cannot for the life of me justify the‚Ä¶

Still has the further exploration of Michael‚Äôs story which is very interesting, and I like the paranoia aspect of a rat in the family.

3419  To start off with, I just have to say The Godfather movies are obviously classics, (bar the third film) but they‚Äôre not the easiest to get through down to their long runtimes and slower pacing than a lot of other films. So they‚Äôre not some of my most enjoyable films, but they are amazing classics.This film was great- I enjoyed the two storylines equally and they were both very strong, I loved Robert De Niro‚Äôs portrayal of Don Vito,‚Ä¶

3422  "Fredo, you're nothing to me now."I never thought I'd get a chance to see The Godfather on the silver screen, let alone its sequel. Neither one is among my all-time favorites, but experiencing two such significant movies the way they were meant to be seen (ignoring the fact that neither was an analog screening), was an opportunity I couldn't pass on. I saw Part I a week ago and had already purchased a ticket for Part II, but contemplated‚Ä¶

3424 the way michael bites into that orange in that one scene was criminal 
3425  everything that needs to be said about this film has been said but i'd like to highlight how well coppola tells this story visually. there's a lot of plot here, this capo here, this other capo there, the revolution in cuba, jumping across timelines but it remains so simple in his direction and faith in his actors. i can't count how many times i knew how each scene was going to play out and that's not because of predictable but‚Ä¶  
3426  ‚ÄúGood health is the most important thing.

Yet, it seems unfair to completely hold Part II accountable for not quite living up equally to the groundworks of what Francis‚Ä¶  
3427  I don't know how Francis Ford Coppola was able to make this film as amazing as it is but he found a way. He managed to continue the story after the masterpiece the first Godfather was and I can happily say that this film is just as amazing as the first film. The story had me invested the whole way through, the cinematography is stunning, the musical score is fantastic, the direction is phenomenal, the screenplay is amazing, the editing‚Ä¶  
3428 A- // 89Compared to Part I,¬†this one had much more defined character arcs which I really appreciated, but the Vito storyline unfortunately petered out towards the end, and many other segments (including the court trials) made it feel a bit too long and bloated. The performances were great though and as said before I loved the moral destruction of Micheal Corleone. (Still don't get the ¬†overblown hype for these films though, they sure are great but nothing incredibly mind-blowing)

3433 If it's possible, this is might be better than it's first part. Darker, more intimate, the themes reverberate loudly and perfectly. Al Pacino is absolutely mesmerizing, and Coppola's handle of such a complicated narrative is terrific. 
3434  The first 40 minutes of this film I was really confident this film was going to be on par if not superior in places to the first film. Especially because of the rating of this on Letterboxd being tied with the rating of the first. I was hoping that we would see the parallels of Vito's rise to power, whilst Michael's loss of control and power (working out who the traitor is etc). Instead we hardly get to see much‚Ä¶  
3435  The Godfather Part II (1974) is a movie that I recently watched for the first time in a long time on Paramount+.

Meanwhile rats are still around him from his fathers passing that don't agree with his business decisions and direction. Michael will need to flush the rats and determine how deep they've penetrated his‚Ä¶

3443 Although it is more of a slow burner than the prequel, De Niro's exceptional performance showcasing young Vito Corleone's rise to the top was the icing on the cake to leapfrog it above its predecessor for me. One of the only critiques I can have (except for the pacing at certain points) was that De Niro could have had a bit more screen time. Al Pacino also gives an Oscar-worthy performance portraying Michael Corleone's demise, which was fascinating to watch. 
3444  Lesson #19 of my Winter of Classics.Alright, like with the previous film it's hard for me to say a lot about a movie that's already been discussed and praised to death. There's a lot of good here, obviously. I will admit that I found much of the movie to be far less engaging and compelling than the first though, and through much of the middle I thought I might wind up rating it lower than this. But the final‚Ä¶  
3445  I didn't really know what to expect from this, but I have heard some people find it better than the first. I'm not sure my stance yet, but it does feel a lot more ambitious than the original film. I really enjoyed this as a deep-dive into Michael's character as we watch him venture down a darker and darker path. I wasn't the biggest fan of the dual timeline because I feel like we were only given a tiny glimpse‚Ä¶  
3446 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   "Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer."Obviously, I loved this movie. It is no doubt one of the greatest movies ever made. I love the prequel-sequel structure. On a technical level, this is a masterpiece. Amazing performances by Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, John Cazale, and really everyone. This contains some of the best framing and blocking in a movie. Like the first one, the score, writing, and cinematography are great.The story is definitely complicated. 200+ minutes‚Ä¶   
3447 "Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer."MY GOD! As great as the original is, the sequel is just as good, maybe better. The cinematography, set design and score is superb.

Also starring Diane Keaton, Michael V. Gazzo, Lee Strasberg and Talia Shire.

3451  "I didn't ask who gave the order because it had nothing to do with business!"The Godfather Part II is that rare sequel that manages to arguably match, if not surpass its predecessor, in its epic grandeur as it assuredly unravels a thoroughly profound character study whose symbolic beauty is consistently matched by the terrific performances and core narrative.

3455 Masterpiece: Part IICoppola makes a brilliant sequel and prequel in one film! Everything is masterful. The directing, writing, acting, music, and cinematography are simply spectacular. 
3456 Quickie Review¬†A sequel that both outdoes and is on the same epic level of the original, Part II follows 2 corresponding journeys: the early years of Don Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro, in an breakout Oscar winning performance) and the later rise and eventual soul corruption of his son Michael (Al Pacino). Everything about this movie is so good, the story, the music, the acting, all of it. Again, I ask you: why are you reading this when you could watching one of the greatest movie sequels of all time? Get to it and make it a double feature with part 1. 
3457 easiest 5 stars i've ever given, love every single thing about this to bits 
3458 Like its predecessor there's one word and one word only to summarize this movie:Masterpiece.Any other word won't do justice to this movie.Added to: My 5 Stars List 
3459  Introduced these 2 to my dad for the first time ever, and upon rewatch I can confidently say this is arguably the greatest film of all time. My top 2 would probably be The Godfather parts 1&2, but I‚Äôm gonna go back and forth forever. There‚Äôs just something special about these, something that holds them above the rest.The Godfather Part II is the standard on how to make an all time great sequel.

His career was unfortunately cut short but he left behind an array of outstanding performances. Rest in peace legend. 
3461 I enjoyed this much better on my second viewing. One of the finest sequels out there. I still like The Godfather Part I a little more, but this was still an excellent sequel that‚Äôs growing on me. Maybe by my next rewatch, I might consider it even better than the original.

But as families grow, attitudes shift, technologies and business evolve, the need for capital trumps all. That "protection" was just greed. That "freedom?" A new prison. Brotherhood matters not when trying to keep afloat and ahead of the storm. The inevitability of capitalism is the complete commodification of bodies, minds, and souls. One look at history will tell you that every empire has an expiration date.

3479 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  I was really close to giving this a 9/10 but it kind of dragged in parts and the stuff with Vito life while I understood why they put it in there it still wasn't nearly as interesting as the main storyline. I kind of hated Fredo in the first one but in this one the ending made me really sad. I really wish he didn't kill him. While Fredo was flawed I really don't think he wanted his brother killed. So yeah I finally watched this classic and while great I still think the first is much better.  
3480  A serious heartbreaker, especially since I've always contended this was superior to the first.[AFI column originally published on Cinema Etc.]The Godfather Part II‚Äòs enduring legacy as the greatest sequel of all time deserves to be challenged. The easiest way of doing so is to revisit it in quick succession with The Godfather. The narrative is even more dense, adding in a parallel plot line that shows Vito Corleone‚Äôs rise to power in New York at the turn of‚Ä¶  
3481  After watching this, my rating for part 1 goes up to a five. Now I've seen both, the story feels a lot more complete and I love the first a lot more. I definitely feel like they make more sense together. I do slightly prefer part 2. I loved the introduction of Vito Corleone and the way they switch beween the two time periods. Robert De Niro was perfect to play a younger version of Vito. He captures his voice‚Ä¶  
3482 Possibly better, definitely more mature than the first. Far quieter and slower, but that gives things a greater weight. The muted colouring in the visuals give it a gorgeous dark feel. Al Pacino is amazing. Robert DeNiro too. My favourite parts were the flashbacks of Vito Corleone - the opening with the death of his mother and brother is one of the best openings I've ever seen. 
3483  That Francis Ford Coppola ever got to make a sequel to The Godfather is a miracle in its own right; The Godfather: Part II turning out even better than the original is a miracle of otherwordly proportions. Considering how much of a struggle Coppola went through on the first‚Äîwith studio interference, executives having little faith in his vision, old geezers not trusting a newcomer‚Äîproblems on top of problems.

3486  To call it a sequel is a travesty.This movie is way to be good to be labelled a sequel to The Godfather . Rather it is more of a companion piece to the original and the two perfectly compliment each other . It is both a sequel and prequel showing the rise of the young vito and moral decline of Micheal .

3487 After the dude filming it last time, I sat in the middle instead of the back in hopes of not seeing someone's phone screen.To anyone who uses their phone in the cinema, it's not the noise, it's the light, the light in a dark room that is distracting. Both Al and Bobby were deliciously handsome in this, almost so much that I couldn't concentrate. 
3488  ANOTHER OFFER YOU CAN‚ÄôT REFUSE¬†It‚Äôs one thing for a sequel to be as good, if not better than the original film. We‚Äôve seen this happen numerous times. With magical pieces like The Dark Knight and Spider-Man 2. But it‚Äôs a whole other thing to nearly match one of the greatest and the single most acclaimed film of all time. That‚Äôs exactly what The Godfather Part 2 does. A journey through morality, following an innocent man‚Äôs arc into a ruthless‚Ä¶  
3489 So yeah Michael Corleone might just be the most bizarre, complicated, fascinating and best character in film ever and I can't believe Al Pacino didn't win an Oscar for this 
3490 Ich dachte der erste Teil k√∂nnte nicht √ºbertroffen werden.Ich lag falsch.Dieser Film ist einer der besten Filme aller Zeiten. Er schafft es eine w√ºrdige, wenn nicht bessere Fortsetzung f√ºr den ersten Ableger der Trilogie zu sein, und liefert gleichzeitig eine verdammt starke Vorgeschichte mit Robert De Niro als Vito Corleone.Ich habe nichts an diesem Film zu bem√§ngeln, nichts! Von vorne bis hinten ist hier alles brilliant durchdacht, gefilmt und inszeniert. Ein Meisterwerk. 
3491  I know this film is far from underrated. Its overwhelming praise is deserving. However after viewing it again, not only do I think it is comfortably the greatest sequel ever made, but it is also superior to the original film.While the first film deals with Michael's ascent to power, GF2 shows us Michael's descent into pure evil with the loss of his soul. Pacino has a few shouty lines in this film, but most of his terrifying moments come‚Ä¶  
3492 One of the best sequels to date. I can't decide if i prefer this or the first one. I think the first one slightly more. Anyway, we are talking about two masterpieces.

3498  Il Padrino Parte II allarga quel che nel primo capitolo della saga veniva dato per gi√† avvenuto e - insieme - completa il disegno dell'inserimento della famiglia Corleone nel tessuto della societ√† americana contemporanea. Francis Ford Coppola articola questa seconda "puntata" su due piani paralleli ed intersecati che sembrano quasi rincorrersi fra passato e presente. Da un lato, descrive come il padrino sia diventato tale, a cominciare da quando giovanissimo fugge dalla Sicilia alla volta di New York. Dall'altro, si‚Ä¶

3500 The original is pretty damn great but this is even better. Al Pacino was fucking perfect, his best performance in the trilogy and probably the best in his career, made his character feel like the most ruthless and unforgiving mafia boss. The story that contrasts the rise of Vito Corleone and the downfall of Michael Corleone is really interesting to watch and it's so tragic especially by the end. And this was so captivating I didn't even feel those 202 minutes at all. 
3501 Wow. In The Godfather Part II, the Corleones organize the murder of a prostitute to win the cooperation of a US senator. And yet, we are supposed to treat Michael Corleone as the hero of this movie? Amazing. And this is a ‚Äúmasterpiece‚Äù of cinema. 
3502 Name a better sequel... I'll wait.... 
3503  Whereas The Godfather, a masterpiece in its own right, has been diminished slightly for me the further I have dug beyond the surface layers of the cinematic canon, hampered somewhat by feeling like a greatest hits package over a 10 year timespan, The Godfather Part II on the other hand is that rare film that just gets better every time you revisit it. When I was 15, and even up until I turned 20, The Godfather was the best film‚Ä¶

3513  I paired "The Godfather Part 2" with Coppola's Merlot. The Merlot is all right, it has a bitter aftertaste that's a bit much for a wine novice like myself. I much prefer Coppola's Claret, which I drank while watching the first "Godfather". But I generally gravitate toward white wines rather than red, so the bitter aftertaste of the merlot might be a common side effect of red wines that I'm just not used to at this point.

3515  It's impossible not to miss Brando's presence although we are compensated by the terrific Pacino-De Niro duo in full glory with a story oscillating between Michael's prime years and Vito's formative years.

3520  I never thought Abe Vigoda holding a cake would make me so emotional. Part II eases ice cold pulp visual muscle to deliver a more novelistic deep dive into character. Instead of a highbrow potboiler about a good son's descent into (sometimes literal) darkness, we're left with a sprawling tragedy of an American family. I think I prefer Part I for its grotesque mood and arthouse remove, but I love Part II for its depth of human feeling and sprawling‚Ä¶  
3521  A solid gold telephone.With one prop, Coppola shows his entire hand, lays all the cards out on the table, and lets you know that the next 2 hours aren't going to be happy. The Godfather Part II is a descent into greed, a movie that starts with a party and a family gathering and ends so far removed from that setting it might as well take place on the moon. The first movie showed the misery of crime and‚Ä¶  
3522 The rare prequel and sequel that manages to somehow top what came before it, Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather: Part II takes everything that was already fantastic about the first film and elevates them tenfold to create what is not only one of the best follow-ups of all time but one of the greatest films ever made in general, a film that's equal parts astoundingly epic and beautifully intimate.

So admittedly so, when first starting my letterboxd, and began to binge rate all the past films I've seen. When it came to this one, I just gave it five stars.Because...I don't know. It felt right.Finally though, I decided to rewatch this now‚Ä¶

3528 The difference in Michael from the first movie to this one is crazy it feels like two completely different people. It was really cool to see De Niro play a young Vito Corleone. This for me is better than the first Godfather movie it was so good. 
3529  "I know it was you Fredo. You broke my heart. You broke my heart!"Wow. I think I actually prefer Part II to the first, not quite enough to give it 5 stars, but that may change in the future when I've had more time to think about it. Much like The Godfather, The Godfather Part II is brilliant on a technical level. It baffles me how Al Pacino didn't get an oscar for his absolutely mesmerising performance, as he‚Ä¶

I know that compared to many other people, this isn't as great of a compliment, seeing as, although I really love it, I don't hold The Godfather to as high of a place as most, but I genuinely believe The Godfather: Part II to be a more accomplished and thoughtful film than its legendary predecessor. Thrilling, absorbing, and absolutely tragic, it isn't at all hard to see why this and Part I are considered one of,‚Ä¶  
3531 young al pacino AND young robert de niro in the same movie who else just died 
3532  JB's review: 7/10"Long but kept me interested." Coppola goes even bigger, two storylines in differents eras and different countries. The sheer scale and elaborate recreation of Little Italy alone is a marvel. It's just insane that De Niro went from Mean Streets to this level of acting. Al Pacino gives yet another career-defining performance, everyone does really. The kitchen scene near the end drives home so well how much has changed over time. Coppola has no problem balancing larger-than-life‚Ä¶  
3533  Never thought I would say this is one of the most heartbreaking films ever. The balance and contrast between the two timelines make up for the perfect complement of two generations, which view and live life in a completely opposite way. The backstory of Vito's origins provides a sense of wisdom that seems completely shattered by Michael's stubborn loyalty to an empty cause. The boat scene still makes my stomach hurt as fuck, it has me dying everytime.Kinda sad‚Ä¶

3536  Ambitious, deeply complex and more impressive in its scope. Where the first film felt confined, almost claustrophobic like the walls of the Corleone house, Part II opens up its world to you; Michael‚Äôs in striking technicolor, Vito‚Äôs in all its warmth and subdued tones. It feels so easy to get lost within these places as you fall in and out of their existence, threaded together to form the complete picture of a decades-old dynasty.

3541 what makes the sequel important & special to the original is the complex and multilayered narrative structure. (which i love a lot.) the film tells two parallel stories, one continues the storyline of michael, now the head of the corleone crime family, while the other dives into the origins and rise to power of his father, vito corleone. both stories are intertwined, giving us a deeper understanding of the characters' motivations and displays the corleone family's evolution as individuals as well as a whole in the crime world.i loved it a lot. my eyes were glued to every frame of it. 
3542 A colossal work of art. There isn't anything like it and likely will never be anything like it. Coppola and Co. mastered the cinematic form.This film does a better job of representing my identity than some tokenistic bullshit like Ms. Marvel. 
3543  Following up¬†The Godfather¬†is a daunting challenge, how do you create a sequel for a movie that is so perfect in every aspect? Well Francis Ford Coppola was able to follow up one of the greatest films ever with an amazing sequel. Sure, I‚Äôm not as big on Part 2 as a lot of people are, but it‚Äôs still a great movie.

The Godfather is in my top 10 of all time; It's sequel now in my top 25.So, yeah, somehow Coppola constructed six full hours of flawless filmmaking with I and II combined.

3573  Watched on Blu-Ray Even before the first part was released, Mario Puzo began working on the screenplay for its sequel, which was to contain the very parts that did not make it into the first film, especially the story of the young Vito Corleone. After the success of "The Godfather", the producers were more than willing to allow Francis Ford Coppola a little more freedom in adapting Puzo's script, so that the scenes in New York around the 1910s were‚Ä¶

3577  After my rewatch of The Godfather reminded me how incredible that film is I was excited to revisit the second part. I‚Äôve always felt like Part II was a step down, but this time around had a feeling like maybe my mind would be swayed and I could see them on par with each other. Alas, I came away more sure than ever of the disparity between the two. I don‚Äôt think Part II is bad by any means, but‚Ä¶

3579 Part II of finally watching The Godfather at 22 years old.Love how Coppola plays on the same plot beats from the last one, albeit with different characters, different ideologies and different motives driving them - the mirrored image of father and son, one self-made in the desire to protect the little people as he becomes a messiah for them, the other driven by power and strolling down the dark path.Both of De Niro's assassination sequences in this - perfection. 
3580  "I know it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart."michael corleone has a quiet intensity bubbling just below the surface. while we witnessed his ascent in part I, we witness his collapse in part II. what's even sadder is we watch his father rise in conjunction with his son's moral decay. the business saturates into the personal until they're one and the same. critics differ in their assessment of his character type, is he a villain or a tragic‚Ä¶  
3581  Day 47 of COVID 19Godfather 2 deserves all the praise it has gained as one of the all-time greatest sequels. It does not feel like the senseless cash grabs of today, but rather an intelligent and expansive companion piece with the first, which is arguably one of the greatest pieces of cinema ever made. I find the fact that 1 and 2 flow seamlessly together and that its hard to distinguish what happens in which ultimately a compliment to‚Ä¶  
3582 This is the first time I've ever seen a literal intermission in a movie lol.I gotta say that I liked the first one more but this is nonetheless a classic. Al Pacino is the fucking man. 
3583 Technical GENIUS, sexiest lighting I‚Äôve ever seen. What a powerful ending too. I love Al Pacino in this, suppressing all that frustration and anger and confusion into cold stares. The whole cast is great, they all thrive in the slow burn pacing. 
3584 Si bien me gust√≥ m√°s la primera, esta segunda entrega es tambi√©n una obra maestra y termina de posicionar a Coppola como el king del cine de los 70. Una segunda parte contada en 2 l√≠neas temporales diferentes pero unidas por los paralelismos entre los 2 protagonistas, Vito y Michael Corleone. La obsesi√≥n y el legado de Vito de mantener la familia ser√° el ancla en las aspiraciones de Michael que ver√° que el mundo de la mafia es mucho m√°s dif√≠cil de lo que pensaba. 
3585 Absolutely massive and outstanding sequel to the first. Might be the best sequel ever filmed. I prefer it to the first one purely because of how ambitious it is, going in between the Vito and Michael storylines. The acting is fucking awesome across the board, the pacing was great and it never lost the heart and sense of family that the first one had. Now for part three... 
3586 First time seeing this film and I got to see it in theaters which was awesome. I liked it a lot, but not as much as the first one. I think a lot of aspects match or surpass the first one, but overall I enjoyed the first one more. For sure one of the best sequels in history tho. 
3587 fredo 
3588 Maybe if this wasn't so canonized in American pop culture as one of the greatest movies of all time, I would have enjoyed it more but alas. I don't understand the hype for this trilogy.Anyways, it's a thousand times funnier knowing Michael's attempts to legitimize the family takes place during the beginning of the Cuban revolution.

3590  Francis Ford Coppola's¬†The Godfather: Part II¬†is darker, bigger and more ambitious in every manner than its groundbreaking predecessor. Yet, whether or not it is truly superior to its predecessor is perhaps, cinema's greatest debate. A near perfect sequel in every regard and almost as strong as¬†The Godfather¬†in every department of filmmaking,¬†The Godfather: Part II¬†certainly brings Puzo's universe into complete expansion and in the most masterful and natural way¬†possible.The Godfather: Part II¬†follows two entirely parallel storylines.

3591  Part of the TSPDT 50% ChallengeThe Godfather: Part II fulfills Michael's descent into the deep depths of darkness - before he's burnt in lava, dons a black mechanical suit and subsequently crushes all rebellions in the galaxy.

Sounds silly and all, but Michael might as well become Darth Vader. However, this lunge into the‚Ä¶  
3592  **Part of the Best Picture Project**There's a lot of conflict over competitively comparing both The Godfather and The Godfather Part II that I simply don't understand. To me, the strength of Part II is that it compliments the first film, like any great sequel should, and it is after all likely the greatest sequel ever made.Here we have Coppola going even more ambitious than his original film, losing his Corman roots, including a bigger timeline, and higher economic‚Ä¶  
3593 I guess I must had belonged to some kind of mafia in another life (if yes, oh that is no good...) but man, I absolutely love mob films!About this film I'll be very direct and simple. It's brilliant as it's predecessor. 
3594  The Godfather II is a gut-punching, three-hour epic that not only tells the story of Michael Corleone, but also the story of the early years of Vito, which I didn't know beforehand and also didn't expect.I have to say, Al Pacino is terrifying and terrific at the same time in this movie. Where in the first part, we witnessed his slow transition into becoming the head of the family, Part II shows the hard reality of his new life‚Ä¶  
3595 Equally memorable and tragically beautiful as the first. Pacino, De Niro, Cazale, and Duvall are all excellent here. The parallel stories of Vito and Michael are such a brilliant choice, the juxtaposition of a rise and a fall has never been better realized. The soundtracks and themes by Nino Rota truly add so much to these films. This struck a chord similar to Better Call Saul‚Äôs final season for me. Devastating storytelling. 
3596  You know, it's funny. Never once throughout the 3hr20 minute runtime of this (wowzers!) did I feel bored per se, but I will say I found myself noticing that this one was lacking in comparison to the first (IMHO of course).I was trying to think of why exactly I felt this way, and I may have found out? I think? Because the cast in this one is so thinned down in contrast to the first, it felt like there‚Ä¶

3598  Some say you could hear an audible sigh around the world of me seeing this was over 3 hours. It was midnight right after I finished the first one and knew I would never make it.

The first day I was really into Michael's story as I just came off Part 1. Second‚Ä¶  
3599  ‚ÄúWhy do you hurt me, Michael? I've always been loyal to you..‚ÄùSeeing this in a theater was an absolute godsend. I got to see the first Godfather for the first time in theaters and it only felt right to see this in theaters as well. Only hits you harder the more you watch it. Seriously some of the best, most definitive filmmaking ever. An embarrassment of riches. Al Pacino is so unbelievably good in this. The ending is one‚Ä¶  
3600  Heralded as one of, if not the greatest, films of all time, Francis Ford Coppola‚Äôs The Godfather: Part II is a film whose cultural impact I both recognize and admire, yet cannot help but state that this praise is overblown. Funny enough, much of my criticism regarding the film is very much in line with my thoughts on its preceding instalment. When I watched The Godfather last year, I stated that I ‚Äúview the film as an important piece to‚Ä¶  
3601  An unparalleled cinematic masterpiece that transcends the very definition of storytelling through film. This legendary sequel to "The Godfather" cements its place as a timeless classic and is undeniablydeserving of a perfect 5/5 rating.Set against the backdrop of the Corleone family's mafia empire, the film weaves a complex and multi-generational narrative, skillfully intertwining the past and the present. The storytelling prowess on display here is nothing short of extraordinary.The parallel narratives, one chronicling the rise of a young Vito Corleone‚Ä¶  
3602 What a great combination of prequel and sequel.Can't believe it's made 50 years ago.I liked the first part slightly more. To be honest. 
3603 Pure and utter perfection. This movie is a slow-burner for sure but it‚Äôs what makes it so perfect; it felt like I was watching two films at once with both these incredible stories unfolding. It‚Äôs rare to see a sequel that builds on its predecessor so perfectly than this. You see the continuation of Michael‚Äôs legacy as the don but you also see the beginning of Vito‚Äôs. Such perfection and I‚Äôm glad to have finally got around to watching this. 
3604  "I know it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart. You broke my heart!"Coppola consegue, mais uma vez, personificar esse envolvimento da fam√≠lia Corleone diante do sistema e, ao mesmo tempo, cria um aspecto de fluxo dram√°tico muito maior do que o primeiro filme. Entretanto, diante de uma l√≥gica menos did√°tica e que sensibiliza o sentimento de Vito Corleone e Michael Corleone, opta-se por uma vis√£o gr√°fica mais pr√≥xima, entre a mescla dos personagens.

3615 I knew I had "made it" as a film buff when I was watching this one time and I realized on my own the two timelines were about the building and the destroying of the family. The perniciousness of evil and of power. One thing I realized this time was that Tom was the one who framed the politician. Had an innocent girl killed, just to get the family's hooks in this guy. I hadn't realized he was so capable of evil himself. Just an awesome movie. I love it. I hate the mafia.

3619  A truly moving film. The lingering of the camera through these situations give this atmosphere to the film that makes it feel way more interesting to stare at. The sequences between Fredo and Michael are probably the most heartbreaking of the entire series. The scene where they hug at their mother's funeral genuinely moved me and the resentment that you could tell Michael still held without a single word being said, added so much depth to the scene.

3623 The Godfather films were made to be seen in cinemas. At home clearly never did them full justice for me. They're just too meticulous and detailed and if you're attention waivers for even a moment you could miss something that changes how you see the whole picture. 
3624 So Robert De Niro grew up to be Marlon Brando and had Al Pacino as a son. 
3625 Ahhhhh I loved it so much! Slightly better than the first in just about every aspect. and it does so well with its handling of the flashback scenes, never once hurting the momentum of the parts in the 1950s. Michael Corleone may very well be my new all-time favorite character, and Al Pacino is SO damn good in the role - literally every slight twitch, every stare, every outburst is pure perfection. Oh, and that ending shot? JEEZ THIS MOVIE IS GREAT

3644 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   One of the very few 9/10s that left me speechless, but I still think the first one is better. I feel like Coppola should have made either a plotwise or emotionalwise connection of the past scenes between the present scenes. These scenes just seemed to exist only to show what was Vito Corleone's life.

3647  Francis Ford Coppola‚Äôs follow up to the multi-Oscar winning classic The Godfather (1972) is for me not only the best sequel ever made, but the best film ever made.

Instead they have the audacity to demand equal, if not greater, results as they strived to catch lightning in a bottle for the second time. You might‚Ä¶

3670  This is beast of a movie and, in contrast to its predecessor, feels every bit the 3 hour 20 minute run time. Admittedly, I fought to stay awake throughout this film, it felt like a marathon. Watched with Kyler and Ted on a Monday and I didn‚Äôt like this installment nearly as much as the Original Godfather film. Aesthetically, this movie is fantastic, but the pacing, message, storyline and organization just felt chaotic and off at times.¬†Primarily, it‚Äôs important‚Ä¶  
3671  This movie is so beautiful on a technical level. The direction and framing are flawless, the acting is superb, and the writing is as solid as a rock. The only thing keeping this from being a 5 star for me, and I hate to say this, It's just too damn long... There was a point before the intermission came where I almost paused it myself to take a breather. I've seen the first one a dozen times at least (this‚Ä¶

3674  This really is one of the greatest sequels ever made, the way it‚Äôs both a sequel and prequel simultaneously is absolutely brilliant. I loved how both story lines contrast each other and manage to keep you engaged, although I did find myself slightly more interested in Vito‚Äôs back story and I kind of wish he was given a full prequel film.¬†I loved De Niro‚Äôs take on Vito and seeing his rise to power.

3676 I'm so glad I rewatched these masterpieces because now I still think they are two of the best films I've seen but for totally different reasons than I did 5 years ago! I don't know if I prefer this or the first one (I think I prefer this by sooooo little but I'm still not sure).It's trully one of the most well-paced films I've ever seen and the structure and balance between the 2 eras is perfect!

3679  I'm going to be honest here, but I'm one of those who likes The Godfather Part II over The Godfather. While I do think The Godfather is a masterpiece, and most probably a better movie, though on a personal aspect I loved this film a little more. I think it went darker and took the premise of the first film and did something alot better. Here we have two stories. A sequel and a prequel. The sequel is the continuation‚Ä¶

The first time I watched this something‚Äôs didn‚Äôt work for me, For example the Vito Corleone story line with Robert Dinero.

3681 really great film, i enjoyed it a lot more than the first one for sure. i did find myself bored at some parts, probably because of the insane runtime but other than that everything was enjoyable. i think the storyline was really interesting, more complex than the first, more fun for me definitely.

3684 Well first off, brilliant film... I am in love with the whole father son dynamic of the film. Whenever there is a father son scene, it switches between Robert Di Nero and Al Pacino. Pure originality there.¬†Great sequel to the Godfather 1. I am not sure which film I prefer. However, I was a bit confused during the Godfather 2 as it was my first watching and found it slightly hard to follow. Other than that, it is still 5/5!

However "sequel" used to be a dirty word.Among Coppola‚Äôs own "movie brat" peers, Scorsese and De Palma have never made a sequel. I wonder why? Even Disney refused to make a sequel until as late as 1990, and they were still controversial when Pixar made Toy‚Ä¶

3723 I found myself far more enthralled with Vito‚Äôs origins than Michael‚Äôs story in this film. That said, the Cuban section, Kay‚Äôs confession, and the loss of the family were incredible moments in Michael‚Äôs story. There were just too many moments, however, where I found myself able to get pulled out of the film, whether it was a dragging pace or just the film‚Äôs ability to live in the excess of its epic tale.

3725 There's really very little I can think to write here. So far between part one and two this is one of the most deftly adapted novels put to film I've ever seen. The epitome of cultural touchstones and lightning in a bottle in simultaneity. While I find it nearly perfect I must say I didn't particularly care for it, which I gather may be the point by Puzo. Perhaps I should read the books as well. Looking forward to watching three and seeing why there's such vitriol toward it.

3731  A good sequel is something I personally feel isn't 'uncommon' in film, in fact, I'd say there are plenty of 'good', heck even 'decent' sequels around for everyone to check out, across countless genres.However, a 'worthy' sequel is an entirely different story in my mind. A worthy sequel isn't just one that builds on the first film (assuming it itself is great enough to warrant a continuation) but it's one that holds all the qualities of that film and‚Ä¶  
3732 Great film not as great as original, my only flaw is Michaels character arc, since it pretty much started and concluded in the first movie he really has nothing to do here, I wish they took the idea of him, turning from a humble nice man to a sinister calculating man, and made it the whole trilogy and not just the first movie 
3733  In my review of The Godfather that I wrote back in July, I wrote that I loved the movie, but I didn‚Äôt see it as one of the best movies ever made and that I found it to be a bit overhyped.

3777  There just aren't other movies that look like the first two Godfather movies. It isn't the use of light, it's the use of shadow that's so black that it is like like light itself.

3780 Michael Corleone: "If you don't listen to me and marry this man, you'll disappoint me". The godfather: part 2 is one of the best squeal's ever made to cinema. The acting is outstanding and the characters feel like real people and not movie characters. 
3781  Harry Dean Stanton! Abe Vigoda! Weaponized abortion!This movie has everything. I always assumed people calling this superior to the og Godfather were doing a spicy take or trying to be interesting or contrarian but this is an entirely different movie and likely my favourite of the two as well.

Unlike many movies that alternate between multiple timelines,‚Ä¶  
3790 I really can‚Äôt decide what I prefer between this than the original. 
3791  Ugh, don't like being critical like this towards a legendary film like this but somehow has to do it: In contrast the tight yet massive structure of the original, this goes for a lot more sprawl and as a result it makes the film feel lost in the woods a lot of the time. The prequel bits should have been exercised completely while Michael's story needed more focus as to what starts off as a revenge story and then just‚Ä¶  
3792 Michael Corleone violently kissing his brother is the pinnacle of all cinema. 
3793  I'm not quite as fond of this one overall, not helped by the fact that this film makes the original better in some aspects, but the final act (post-intermission) is actually perfect and by far the best part of either of these films.Al Pacino is fantastic: he's seemingly aged 20 years in the span just two. The first time De Niro speaks and sounds exactly like Brando's Vito was genuinely a shock (though it's a bit of a shame‚Ä¶

3796 Not just a sequel, but another masterpiece of continuing story. One of the most tragic film out there. 
3797 It is so neatly in conversation with its predecessor that the two will always live together in my head. I know and feel that Part II¬†is a more grand and epic cinematic achievement, although I do think the first will go on to be more rewatchable.These two films truly did live up to every expectation I had of them. I will soon be watching the recut Godfather Coda¬†instead of the original version of Part III, but for now I will be seeing 80 for Brady¬†in twelve short hours and Coppola‚Äôs masterwork was simply a pregame for it.

3800 As the viewer, we spend a lot of time looking into Michael¬†Corleone‚Äôs eyes. They were so hopeful in Part 1, more filled with innocence. Now they‚Äôre dead and black. Aged on a young face. Never blinking. They‚Äôre terrifying, more so than anything else about him. 
3801 one of the best sequels 
3802 Spanning across two different time periods, The Godfather Part II delivers in its malevolence and blinding of one Michael Corleone. The complete contrast in corrupt idealistic family figure and an immigrant family initiator is what beholds the true tragedy within Michael. I did struggle to hold interest in the first 45 minutes however the story did pick up with the unfolding of betrayals at Michael‚Äôs feet and for most of the runtime I was engaged. Though not as epic as the original, The Godfather Part II is certainly a classic of cinema. 
3803 I like to imagine a world where we get epics like this every year instead of so much prestige TV that tries to do the same thing with more filler, weak cgi, and no theatrical scope 
3804 yeah yeah ok it‚Äôs pretty good. Whatever 
3805  After having rewatched the first movie (and having come to like it), it was almost inevitable not to create expectations for this one (especially since it is as praised as its previous one). I can already say that I liked it and it was different from what I expected. Rather than focusing on family and role succession, the focus is on showing how Michael is managing his father's legacy, while also showing Vito Corleone's past (and that was a surprise).‚Ä¶  
3806 crazy how this changed my life 
3807 A movie that over the years has only grown in stature for me. First time I saw this back in high school I was really only interested in the Michael storyline, whereas these days I'm enthralled from beginning to end.¬†Also holy jeez, Coppola does not mess around with his 4K restorations, another immaculate disc. 
3808 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Score: 97%For the second film in a row, Al Pacino has been the best performance in spite of the actor playing Vito winning an Oscar (not that Robert DeNiro isn't great of course.) Also, this is amazing. Perhaps it was just the cinema sound system, but I found the sound of the gunshots to really echo throughout the film. They don't occur that often, and as such every time they do occur it gives the scene an added sense‚Ä¶   
3809 the shot of fredo on the boat <3 
3810 takes everything that the first movie does perfectly and adds to it in the best way possible. every single moment is like stepping into an old photograph, every crowd feels real and personal, like you‚Äôre living in the moment watching it exist. an engaging plot from start to finish that allows you to form¬†a deep emotional connection, to feel the characters and their layered development from so many perspectives. the longest movie i‚Äôve ever watched, but i wish it could go on forever 
3811  okay, here's my pitch: it's a tom hagen spinoff show a la better call saul, but it's filmed like a 90's sitcom and revolves around the lighthearted woes of being a hardworking lawyer under a mafia don maybe tom arrives at the airport the find his flight has been delayed *seinfield bass riff*. he sighs and uses a payphone to call vito, who speaks through unintelligible noises like the adults in charlie brown. what zany shenanigans will have to ensue‚Ä¶  
3812  I just love the way they hug like yas *muah*.That said I do think the first is just that much better. Going into the triology as a whole my presumption was that I‚Äôd be witness to an illustrious, grand operatic saga of power, prestige, family and crime and though some of that it is, both Godfather films I‚Äôve seen have been ones that find their eminence in their apparent tranquility and their underlying virtue in their simplicity.

3817  The story is more engaging for me in this film than in its predecessor, but it lacks the former‚Äôs intense artistry of composition and editing (the film is so long!). I really like the way the two stories intertwine to make this both a sequel and a prequel. More novelistic than cinematic.¬†The performances are extremely good, from all involved, but I was especially riveted by Robert De Niro and Al Pacino‚Äîso often I feel like they overact, but here‚Ä¶  
3818 Don‚Äôt mind me just logging this additional masterpiece for the first time ... 
3819  The Godfather Part Two is possibly the best film ever made, every part of this film is amazing, I'm not gonna compared this to the first one cause Both is damn great, I was very surprised by this. The story is amazing, everything makes perfect sense. The dialogue is some of the most original, and realistic ever putt on screen, the characters are flawless, and it's in every way perfectly written. The acting is just as fantastic, I can't believe‚Ä¶  
3820 The Godfather: Part II is a sequel that manages to be superior (even despite the sometimes sluggish pace). The flashbacks of Vito Corlone, add so much poignancy and punch to Michael's character and story, with Al Pacino giving a stupendous performance, and Robert De Niro excellently portraying young Vito.Like the original, the cinematography and Coppola's filmmaking is exceptional, and the final few minutes are powerful, emotional cinema.

3826 ‚ÄúIf history has taught us anything, it‚Äôs that you can kill anyone.‚Äù¬†If The Godfather is about who is doing the murdering, then Part II is about who is getting murdered. That‚Äôs for sure. Death is played here on a sheet of one-note music ‚Äî that note being tragic, deeply upsetting, and impactful. Coppola capitalizes on a few major set-ups, too, in golden fashion. Kay gets the door. Fredo fumbles. Michael descends into the darkness without looking back. 
3827  Just like the first one, this is a masterpiece of filmmaking. A sequel and a prequel to The Godfather, it blends both storylines so well together through themes, violence, and epic storytelling. I enjoy the Vito Corleone storyline a bit more out of the two, but it‚Äôs only by a slim amount. I love me a good revenge tale and it‚Äôs one of the classics. De Niro is absolutely magnetic as a young Vito, and does a great job of‚Ä¶

It's‚Ä¶  
3829  From New York to Havana, past to present, The Godfather Part 2 is an exercise in contrast. Two storylines thematically juxtapose Vito‚Äôs fateful rise and Michael‚Äôs tragic downfall, a truly epic narrative that dwarfs the first film in its complexity.Vito‚Äôs story - from Sicilian childhood to burgeoning crime boss - acts as a wonderfully compelling prequel. We witness circumstance and encounters mold the young immigrant into the Don we know so well, through a lively pace and quaint period‚Ä¶

I'm not sure if I had expectations but I'm slowly starting to see why some would call these the greatest films ever made even if I think that is somewhat big exaggeration. But great films they definitely are, open a little bit more the more you grow and I think the true test of maturity with these films is how you‚Ä¶  
3834 Any movie featuring Harry Dean Stanton is automatically great.This movie feels like an expansion on the original's story and characters in ways few other sequels could ever match. Everything is outstanding, from the lighting and camerawork to the performances. Just one detail bug me a bit; how could anyone expect us to believe Robert De Niro got old to be Marlon Brando? Naaah.

3839 De Niro is fun, Pacino is fucking great and Coppola knows how to work at this scale on a scene-by-scene level, but I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that in spite of its¬†exorbitant length (a good 30+ minutes longer than the first one, lest we forget) it feels strangely hurried. I‚Äôm sure Coppola is sitting on at least another hour of footage somewhere, so whenever he releases that I‚Äôll probably come back this and love it like everyone else does.

3854  The Godfather is a masterpiece. I get it, one of the best ever made, absolutely. But it‚Äôs never been one that I‚Äôve had any real sort of connection to beyond sheer appreciation of everything it does.

I find the narrative really difficult to follow (but that's on me, not the film).That being said, I loved how we got more of Vito Corleone's backstory. I wouldn't mind an entire film dedicated to that, as it was really interesting to see his rise to power. 
3861  52 Years In 52 Weeks: 2021 Edition11. 1974-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Let's just say I am torn on this one.Following the passing of Don Vito Corleone in the last film, his son Michael has taken over the reigns of the Corleone family empire. You'd think that some young fresh blood would revitalize the family but snooping politicians and shaky family ties make things harder. And while we follow Michael's struggles we also get the occasional flashback to Vito's past life,‚Ä¶

3868  What an interesting exercise to watch a series of films in quick succession: without the years of hype that the production results in at the time, some sense of clear-eyed observation settles in. Joining a fellow Letterboxder for their first foray into the Godfather trilogy, I was interested to look back at these first two instalments which lingered only hazily in my memory. It came with quite a weight of expectation; this being the go-to example of a sequel that‚Ä¶  
3869 The greatest sequel ever made. The rise of Vito and the fall of Michael. Two films for the price of one. It‚Äôs an epic gangster film that weaves themes of family, morality, trust and betrayal for almost 3.5 hours.¬†While I do prefer Chinatown, I do believe that this film deserved its Best Picture win. And that final shot, heartbreaking. 
3870 I thought I had seen this about a decade ago, right after I watched the first one for the first time, but none of the movie seemed familiar so maybe this was my first time seeing this????¬†Anyway, this little movie is good. I hope it gets the exposure it deserves ü§ûüèª 
3871  It would seem near impossible for Coppola (or anyone else for that matter) to top the masterpiece that is The Godfather (1972), but with Part II (1974), he did just that... or at least came pretty close. I've favored this sequel to the original for some time, but upon revisiting them both back to back, I think the first one had the slight edge. For as outstanding as these films are, Coppola's Apocalypse Now (1979) could very well be better.‚Ä¶  
3872  To be perfectly perfectly honest, it did take me exactly 1 hour to get into the film, yes 1 hour.But as soon as I did everything just suddenly became extraordinaire, magnificent, grandiose, immense and majestic to my eyes. (words are missing)I keep asking myself how is it possible that the film is 3h20 long, seriously 200 minutes how the fuck ?No lengths (in my opinion), nothing too much, just the perfect editing, the perfect dosing. Just everything‚Ä¶  
3873  what an amazing sequel! everything that made the first one great is present here but it manages to be even more ambitious, as it tells the before and after of the first film. it‚Äôs more layered, darker and a lot more complex.the parallel between vito corleone‚Äôs ascent and michael‚Äôs demise is extremely interesting and the immigrant question is very well explored. vito‚Äôs like a romantic robin hood whose violence feels kinda justified and exciting, while michael feels so cold‚Ä¶  
3874  I know it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart. You broke my heart!Part 2 to Coppola's epic crime drama is less visually evocative than its predecessor. The Rembrandt-esque hues are traded here for a less painterly, more naturalistic palette. There's inspiration to be found, here, for sure; Coppola shifts us from the grimy streets of New York to Las Vegas and Havana and Sicily. But, where Part 2 truly stands apart from it's predecessor is in narrative structure.‚Ä¶  
3875 It‚Äôs not quite the outright gripping masterpiece I consider the first film to be, but it‚Äôs so impressive in its scale and ambition, and so melancholically moving, that it still stands up as a truly worthy sequel. Pacino is even better than the first, bringing a true coldness that‚Äôs completely captivating, and De Niro is just perfect as a young Vito, a true predecessor to Brando‚Äôs character. As with the first, the lengthy runtime just flies by, utterly engrossing at nearly every turn - as far as sequels go, it‚Äôs up there with the greatest.

3877 That fact that the same man who directed this made Jack starring Robin Williams, a film about a 10 year old boy who looks like a grown man, will never not be the funniest thing to me üò≠ 
3878  If you thought nothing can top The Godfather, think again.The sheer brilliance of juxtapositioning a young Vito Corleone, building his empire with principal and compassion. Whilst Michael strips the same empire from all the trust and confidence it once had and loses whatever was left of himself, by the end of the first film, in the process. Two sides of the same, blood-soaked, coin."I'm your older brother, Mike, and I was stepped over!""That's the way Pop wanted‚Ä¶

3900  Saw this for the first time through the 50th anniversary rerelease at Regal.It's a bit harder to follow than the first with more complex deals, hits, and schemes, but The Godfather Part II is still a wonderful film that continues one of the most tragic and compelling character arcs of all time.

3901  One of the all time greats. Or probably the alone greatest thing ever made in the history of cinematography. This movie is both "prequel" and "sequel" of the first godfather movie.

3912  #RetoCinefiloSo much has been written and said about this movie that it's a bit challenging to write something new. There is, however, something that most reviews miss about The Godfather Part II.One hears it called more of a continuation than a sequel, hence the "Part II" in the title.

Don't put it off for a year and then push yourself because it's part of a list that you wanna complete. Watch it. Study it. This is everything the first was but better, it's more emotional, it's jaw-dropping, suspenseful, and heartbreaking in so many aspects. Where the first was the rise of a criminal, the second is the downfall of a human. This movie is damned incredible, guys. 
3926 better than the first even though their both perfect movies. made its way in my top 5 
3927 A+"Times are changing." The capital-driven horrors and desolation of the prior film now further bleeding into the generational impact of an American family's moral decay and inevitable downfall; one which remains as accomplished as the innovative brilliance behind the camera (ex: atmospherics reflecting the freedoms, artistry, and emotionality of a narrative). A span of humanity diluting itself across time. 
3928 Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.It's undoubtedly a worthy sequel to a first-rate film. Al Pacino seriously should've won a best actor Oscar for his performance in this. 
3929  After watching the first Godfather, I had high expectations for the sequel. Almost everywhere I could read that the sequel was as good or even better than the first one. I would like to make a note of that. I certainly like them both in terms of film. That's for sure. Still, I don't think there's enough story of 'contemporary events' in the sequel. In my opinion, it focuses a little too much on Vito's past. This is personal, of‚Ä¶  
3930 The Godfather: Part II is the darker more brooding child of the legendary first film. This is a near perfect sequel and succeeds in every area where The Godfather did. With that said Marlon Brando had a wow factor that I feel cannot be fully achieved by any other character. Al Capone is incredible but he doesn't give me chills the way Brando did. I think nothing will ever be able to recreate the wow factor of my first viewing of The Godfather, and the fact that this film is even able to come close shows how excellent it is. 
3931 ¬øLa mejor pel√≠cula de todos los tiempos? Es un adjetivo bastante justo para calificar a esta obra maestra. 
3932  Franky Coppola's epic sequel is considered the best of the trilogy and to many people the best mafia flick. Regardless of where you stand on it, it is an ambitious and engaging continuation of the Corleone saga.Weaving together an origin story of Vito Corleone's arrival to the US and slow rise of power with Michael Corleone's predicaments of betrayal within his circle as the new Don provides an abundance of plot twists and "woah" moments. Let's just say, this‚Ä¶

3941 Perfection. 
3942  Constructed at a scale somewhat beyond comprehension, and told with a clarity it's hard to fault, The Godfather: Part II centres on a tale as old time. On the one hand, a family rises to prominence, and on the other its ensuing success causes it to implode. The purpose behind telling these two stories both in parallel isn't always clear, but that's only because Coppola mostly resists the urge for easy dramatic irony, instead playing the rising fortunes and declining‚Ä¶  
3943  If I consider the first one to be romanticism of mob life, then this has to be the one dealing with thematic values. Michael Corleone is the most tragic character, we see his transition from an upbeat, jolly guy trying to have a well settled lifestyle into a cold-blooded gangster. Michael suffers from the tragedy of succession, having Vito's flashbacks (wonderfully played by DeNiro), added a lot more contrast between the two godfathers, as for one it was the rise‚Ä¶  
3944  Obviously great, obviously iconic.That being said, this is a sloppy season of TV compared to the wholly functional original. I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve sat around listening to decades of debate over which one was better, only to walk into a complete hands-down no-contest situation. I mean, that first one MOVES, is completely self-contained, and asks very little of the viewer outside of a desire to be entertained by dramatics. The only upside to this slight disappointment is that I‚Ä¶

3947 Easily the best mafia film ever made. The best film ever made? I'm here for the discussion. 
3948 According to IMDb trivia, filming for ‚ÄúThe Godfather Part II‚Äù (1974) took three weeks‚Äîmuch longer than ‚ÄúThe Godfather Part I,‚Äù (1972) which took two hours. 
3949  there is something about these films that feels so personal to me. i love all the characters immensely and my heart breaks for all of them. the world is so rich. it feels lived in and for some weird reason it gives me comfort. michael might be one of, if not my favorite fictional character of all time, and watching his life fall apart because of his mistakes breaks my heart. the ending scene with michael alone at the table‚Ä¶  
3950 So it is possible to play a younger version of a character accurately while still elevating and bringing unique attributes to them?¬†Take notes, Ehrenreich. 
3951  I have no shame in admitting that I do not enjoy The Godfather films in the slightest. Not a lot peaked my interest in that seemingly never ending 200 minutes, apart from how well shot some of the scenes were shot and some of the more dramatic moments, so I'll give Coppola that. But it was very rare that enough was happening in one moment, and as for the story itself, I felt like somebody needed to shake me awake‚Ä¶  
3952 Was a treat to see this in theaters for the 50 year anniversary. 
3953  The most critically beloved cashgrab in film history.That's not a shot at the movie, by the way, it's a rarely acknowledged fact that both Coppola and Pacino only agreed to return for the money. "They made an offer I couldn't refuse!" famously stated Coppola. "The ridiculous amount of money I asked for, they didn't seem to care." Pacino only came back when his salary was upped from the $35,000 of the first film to a staggering $500,000 ($3.18 million‚Ä¶  
3954 How in the *blue hell* was Gordon Willis not Oscar-nominated for his superlative cinematography for this movie? Madness.It's that cinematography - as well as a better score from Nino Rota, richer performances (my Supporting Actor Oscar vote would've gone to Michael V. Gazzo as Frankie Five Angels, only because John Cazale was inexplicably snubbed), and that amazing dual narrative - that pushes the sequel over the spectacular first installment.I can know exactly what's coming and how it's coming, but it still hits unbelievably hard each and every time. A towering cinematic achievement. 
3955  Somehow I've called myself a film fan for years and never saw this, and fuckin hell did it live up to every expectation. The two films that exist inside this film, Michael's story and young Vito's, by themselves could have been incredible films, but the cross between them, often with Coppola slowly fading from a close-up of Michael to Vito, makes each of them richer and creates a true masterwork. The cinematography, score, and performances are once again perfect. The‚Ä¶

3971 Need a full movie of just Frank Pentangeli trolling various courtrooms for a few hours 
3972 For as big of a punch the first one brought, I think I prefer this one just marginally because of how it doubles down on Michael‚Äôs abandonment from his family and how it intercuts with his father starting the life Michael has thrown away, perfectly reflecting and comparing their lifestyles. This is a monumental story and masterpiece of filmmaking. 
3973 My hot take is that I liked the first one better! 
3974 More Joe Spinell, more stars. The theatrical cut or CODA for my first viewing of¬†Part III? Please advise

I still don't understand why it took me so long.It was without a doubt a fantastic experience. One of the best movies ever made. Incredibly, it didn't even seem to be 3 hours long, it flew by.

3977 Again, great score, it actually got even better.¬†Michael barely scratched the surface of sicko mode in this one, but it was enough to make it more fun than the first movie. Disc one was sick as hell, but disc two offered the necessary drama and tension-building. 
3978  The highest standard of a sequel was created by this movie. We see the rise of the head of the Corleone family, Vito Corleone, arriving in America at the beginning of the 20th century and establishing his criminal empire. DeNiro of course legendary as the young, ambitious and vengeful mafia don. Fanucci and Don Ciccio? Ptooey! Also we watch the rise of Michael Corleone, an icy, cold blooded Al Pacino, establishing his power of the underworld in brutal fashion after‚Ä¶  
3979  As is the case with Part I, The Godfather Part II is an easy 5 star movie for me and is among my top 20 favorite films ever made. I won't lie, I didn't remember a lot of this film going into this rewatch. Hell, I'd argue the only reason I did this Godfather rewatch was simply to get to Part II due to me wanting to remember what it was I loved about this film. Well now I know‚Ä¶  
3980 it‚Äôs very personal to me ... 
3981  One Michael Corleone continues to be one of the most compellingly written characters ever put to screen. I had a lot to say about this throughout the runtime but now that it‚Äôs finished I‚Äôm kind of lost on a lot of those thoughts, not because it was overwhelming, I guess by the end I can just sum that up pretty basically. It‚Äôs a great crime epic. I really wish we saw more of De Niro as a young Vito, that‚Ä¶  
3982  A stellar film but it pales in comparison to the first in several ways mainly I felt this film had poorer pacing and yet it still felt like there were things missing from it. I just simply wasn‚Äôt as invested in comparison. I still found the performances and direction to be great, Al and Robert particular standouts. The parts with Vito always seemed more compelling to me even though they were more minimal overall and after the intermission I found‚Ä¶  
3983  My history of ‚ÄúThe Godfather: Part II‚Äù spans several years ‚Äì and several viewings ‚Äì of my life, each moment culminating in where I am currently. My mother, who I often credit with kickstarting my love for Cinema, showed me ‚ÄúThe Godfather‚Äù at a very formative time in my life: my taste was changing from Blockbuster extravaganza to certified Classics of the medium and when she showed me it, it changed how I viewed Cinema ‚Äì it had awakened something‚Ä¶

3985 haha guess i have a thing for fictional mob bosses from the 1900s 
3986 Unlike Part: I, THE GODFATHER: Part II is boring, irritating, too confusing, too much work and of course too long. I'd rather the sequel‚Äôs story told in a much shorter runtime. If you wanna understand the mafia and Italian-American families, watch it. The US of A encapsulated. 
3987 So tell me, how the fuck is there a part 3?!10/10 
3988 I should probably rewatch this one. I don't remember much from my viewing of the movie, just being bored of the long length. Unfair, I know, and especially given it's the same creative team and cast as the first "Godfather" (which I do like), I might just need a more mature perspective to reevaluate it. Three stars. 
3989 One of the best movies ever made, part 2. 
3990 45th anniversary of 'The Godfather Part II': *insert Al Pacino's "What a picture" from 'ONCE UPON A TIME IN... HOLLYWOOD'*Pick any 2 characters and there will be at least one moment of writing brilliance between them - the main reason why 'The Godfather' still holds up for me and what a rare feat of (prequel-cum-)sequel living up to the (PERFECT here) original!P.S. Big fan of brilliant dissolve shots in 'The Godfather Part II' during the intercutting between Vito Corleone's rise & Michael Corleone's fall - Kudos to the editors and of course, "The Prince of Darkness" Gordon Willis!

3992 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   While The Godfather (1972) and The Godfather: Part II are both five-star films, I would have to give a slight edge to Part II: it's just a bit deeper and richer.Part II continues the story of Michael Corleone in Nevada. There is a lot of political intrigue as Michael tries to expand his territory. The film also focuses on his deteriorating relationship with his wife.Intercut with the present-day material‚Äîwhich is taking place in the late 1950s‚Äîis the origin‚Ä¶

It could not have been more perfect.Discussing THE GODFATHER films is always very tricky as they have been dissected so much over the years. It is hard to find a different take so all I can do is go over my feelings. These films are classics, both I and II, and deserve‚Ä¶  
3995  Maybe it's a little strange to watch The Godfather: Part II on New Year's Eve, but I've been thinking about Al Pacino recently and I haven't watched this in forever!My opinion that this is better than the first one still stands, and I liked it even more the second time. The sequel is a little longer, but it doesn't exactly feel that way. The pacing moves the story along quite well, and it doesn't feel like it hangs too‚Ä¶  
3996 if you get extreme goosebumps just from hearing The Godfather theme play in the first minute while the titlecard appears onscreen, you know you're in for another cinematic experience of your life... a sequel that lived up to the high standards the first film had set. A MASTERPIECE 
3997  "The Godfather" is unquestionably one of the finest achievements in cinema history, and it's just astounding how much this sequel manages to almost exceed it in many ways. Fleshing out the character arc of Michael Corleono, and even richer in storytelling, it's incredible how beautifully Francis Ford Coppola is able to balance the individual stories of Michael's rise to power while also essentially telling the origin of Vito Corleono and making each scene just as involving as the last. DeNiro‚Ä¶  
3998  After news broke out that Hollywood was planning a sequel to The Godfather, no one could see how they could even try to top such a perfect and excellent film. Since this came out, this has been regarded as one of those rare films that surpass the original.Al Pacino is incredible. Robert De Niro gives an incredible breakout performance. The whole cast is amazing. The script is fully realized. Works as both a sequel and a prequel. It's mesmerizing‚Ä¶  
3999 This sequel is also great but why do they got our boy Pacino looking like an ice cream cone on the poster? They did him like they did Choi Min-sik on the Oldboy poster smh.

4005 "I don't feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom.

One of the most depressing character arcs of all time.Prefer the first film by a small bit but the downright devastating ending of this might be the best one in movie history? 
4006 What can I say that hasn't been said before, truly one of the best films ever made and probably the best sequel ever made too. Has to be seen by everyone without fail. 
4007  The Godfather Part 2 is a brilliant crime drama that sets the stage of amazing sequels that is I think is close to topping the original with two investing storylines about the hopeful tale of Vito Corleone of the past and the tragic tale of Michael Corleone. Miraculously managing to both enrich and expand upon themes first broached by its predecessor, it certainly ranks among the very best of all sequels in American cinema.

4016  A simply staggering achievement to come off the first film and produce a follow-up of this magnitude, it's often said the 70s is the best of American cinema and when one considers the decade was opened up in such fashion as it was by Coppola's Godfather films... it's hard to argue otherwise, because everything else that came in their wake was just a bonus on top of these incredible films.Al Pacino is mesmerizing as Michael Corleone, he commands the‚Ä¶

4019  The Godfather Saga #2- The Rise of Vito Corleone, The Evolution of Michael CorleoneThe Godfather Part II has absolutely earned its reputation as one of the greatest sequels ever made, and barring The Empire Strikes Back (I'd slip T2 and love me or hate me for it Toy Story 2, Shrek 2 and Across The Spiderverse but thats just me talking) there's little competition for the greatest American film sequel.

4042  The tone of The Godfather turns from the nostalgia and mournfulness of Part I to the tragic in Part II. The structure of the second is different as well. The screenplay moves us both backward and forward in time: It takes us to events that took place before Part I, as young Vito Corleone leaves Sicily for America. It also picks up where Part I left off, with Vito's son Michael establishing himself as Don. Michael has transferred the family's‚Ä¶

4046 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Considered by many as the best film of all time, The Godfather was first released in 1972, and finished with the rise of Michael Corleone. The Godfather: Part II, released 2 years later, is to me, a perfect sequel, and by many others, even better than the first one.¬†De Niro as Vito CorleoneBefore jumping into Michael, this film is also focused on Vito Corleone‚Äôs youth and first steps before becoming The Godfather.

4049  7.4/10i know this movie is considered one of the best movies of all time, but to be honest, i think is just a good movie and nothing more than thatthe first one is waaaaay betteri mean, there are some good moments, especially in the last acti had fun while i was watching it, and the 3 hours and 20 are not boring at all, which is a hard thing to do but nothing here marked me,‚Ä¶  
4050 i seriosuly don‚Äôt know why this movie is so comforting i feel held by it it feels like home to me 
4051 Another epic flawless masterpiece. This serves as both a prequel and a sequel to The Godfather and is thought by some to be the best film ever made. Personally I still think Brando makes the original a better film. 
4052  While I don't think that The Godfather: Part II is a masterpiece like the first one and certainly not as enjoyable or emotionally moving, it is still an incredibly admirable film. I didn't think that the prequel-sequel schtick would work for me, but it really really did! Displaying Vito's rise to power while displaying Michael's fall from it is a stroke of genius, as it shows exactly why Vito is the true Godfather and why Michael will never be a‚Ä¶  
4053  I don't think Part 2 flows as well as the Part 1, and the tone is overall more sinister and nihilistic, but at the end of the day this is still one of the best movies ever made. They took the perfection of the first film and added De Niro. You can have no poor outcome from that equation. It's impossible.Watching this nowadays, I'm always struck by how immaculate and beautiful it is. It's a triumph in every department,‚Ä¶  
4054  my dad loves to gripe about how bad de niro's accent is but i think the flashbacks being almost entirely in italian is vital ‚Äì this is a movie about cultural identity as much as anything else, and the way that it erodes and reshapes itself over time. the most overtly comedic moment comes when pentangeli attempts to instruct the distinctly non-italian band to play a tarantella, but when the clarinet player can't get it he ends up playing pop‚Ä¶

He doesn‚Äôt see his brother as a brother, he sees him as the weakest link, a liability, a‚Ä¶   
4056 I‚Äôm just constantly astonished with how amazing the first one is the sequel is that much stronger of a film. Pacino‚Äôs performance is one of the greatest screen illustrations I have ever seen. His eyes tell it all. What‚Äôs also brilliant is the politics that weaved in, Cuban liberation and little tidbits about American government activity make this film about the life of crime family into a allegory about Americanism and how America‚Äôs imperial spirit is one of decay, The Corleone families failure being the archetypal example.¬†Just one of my all time favorite pictures. Love to watch it yearly. 
4057 When I heard of The Godfather, I thought it sounded like a great film from the get go. Then I finally watched it and yeah it‚Äôs a masterpiece, then after finally getting my stupid PlayStation controller to work I watched a film and my god, literally.¬†These two are some great times. I just loved this one a bit more because Michael is such a great character and with ROBERT DE NIRO as Vito was amazing.¬†With that runtime though, after the first hour it didn‚Äôt bother me. 
4058  Before I get angry messages, I know it's not 5-stars in my rating, just know that I still really like this film quite a lot. The flashback scenes featuring Robert De Niro are perfect. They're stunningly beautiful and add more texture to that great character that compliments everything we saw with Vito in Part I. I love that he wasn't too dissimilar from Michael when he was younger in terms of violence, but his motivations were very different. And that's‚Ä¶

4062  this was a great contrast in comparison to the original godfather film ‚Äî the first one being more about the rise and physical necessities when it comes to joining the family business, while this one takes a look more into the psychological aspect of the business and how it affects you and others.michael‚Äôs character arc from the previous film to this one is not only absolutely amazing, but extremely horrifying. not to mention, the acting is fantabulous ‚Äî john‚Ä¶  
4063 The continuing saga of the Corleone family has Al Pacino‚Äôs Michael leading the family through deals, betrayals, and tragedies.¬†Robert DeNiro also stars through flashbacks as a young Vito Corleone from seeing his parents murdered to escaping Italy as a young child to go to America on his own.¬†Great epic film.

4065 Always my favorite of the trilogy. One of the greatest sequels ever made. 
4066  The Godfather Part 2 is often regarded as the greatest film of all time. With many claiming it to be better than its predecessor. Racking up a runtime of 200 minutes, this behemoth is the longest theatrical film I've seen. For those of you who read my review on Part 1 would know that my only gripe was with pacing issues, particularly in its third act which dipped completely to a point where I became uninterested. With no Marlon Brando‚Ä¶  
4067 Viewed on Blu-rayAs wonderful as The Godfather Part II (1974) is, what makes it a masterpiece are the flashback scenes of Vito Corleone's journey.It makes The Godfather Part II (1974) superior to The Godfather (1972). 
4068 For my money this is the single greatest cinematic achievement to date. Nobody has done better. It's a beast that is able to do anything it puts its mind to. 
4069  Most of the time when dealing with a sequel there is a stigma towards them that they are no where near as good as the original. And in most cases that is true but in this case it is not. And while I will not say that this movie is better than the original, even thought a lot of people do think it is. I will say that it matches the first one stroke for masterful stroke. As I can‚Ä¶  
4070 If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it is that you can kill anyone.My 1,000th film here on letterboxd! Honestly these movies are so much fun to watch. I think I prefer Part I mainly because of Brando, but Part II is not a slight to the series in any way. Al Pacino plays Michael Corleone with such intensity, his scenes with Kay were my favorite. 
4071 "Senator, we're both part of the same hypocrisy. But never think it applies to my family."-Michael CorleoneSuch victorious art. Much wow. Everything in this film is just too perfect. Watching The Godfather Part II is such an honor. And I feel like a puny creature who doesn't deserve such gargantuan honor. Lol. 
4072  Ay, madre, vaya tarde bien empleada.Creo que me gusta m√°s la primera por tener una historia mas sencilla y emocional. Con unos temas y una estructura m√°s universales y cl√°sicos.Esta es m√°s enrevesada y fr√≠a, los "negocios" tienen m√°s peso. Por otro lado... de eso se trata. De mostrar c√≥mo la mafia "rom√°ntica" de Vito, basada en el respeto, la jerarqu√≠a y el intercambio de favores para construir la lealtad se ha convertido en la mafia de los‚Ä¶  
4073  Let's just get it out of the way to begin with, The Godfather is the better film (in my estimation, by quite a bit). Main issue is that while the three-plus hours are as immensely watchable as the first, there's also about half the interest. In essence, the film‚Äîat least the Michael Corleone section‚Äîis one long denouement. It's the culmination of what began in the first film, only with less complication. There's no question of where the film is headed,‚Ä¶  
4074  Francis Ford Coppola's, The Godfather: Part 2, is a very solid follow up to the legendary first film. I've heard some say they prefer it to the original. That was not the case for me, but it took several viewings of The Godfather before I finally liked it anywhere near as much as most people do. Maybe the same thing will happen with this sequel, only time will tell. Soon I'll be watching the 3rd film. I've heard it's easily‚Ä¶  
4075  I sometimes forget the impact of this one, but it was my first "favorite movie" when such declarations really began to matter. I found something important in the way that this sequel, as a separate work, dared to critically explore the effect and implication of its predecessor's world--and, moreover, how it so deftly integrated written history into its lore. That approach probably accounts for how I view films (and works in other media, too) as objets d'art; as singular entries‚Ä¶  
4076 You're never going to find a more perfect piece of fiction than Godfather 1 and 2. Two absolute masterpieces. 
4077  Unlike its predecessor, I found the lengthy three and a half hours runtime to be quite tiresome, as the storyline failed to grasp me in a same way it did on the previous occasion. Whilst there were some gripping moments, they were mostly reserved for the climactic portions, leaving the middle segment lacking in much-needed urgency and momentum.Furthermore, the constant jumps between the present and the past at regular intervals felt disjointed, causing the narrative to become convoluted. While‚Ä¶  
4078 Part 1 is still ever so slightly better imo, but they‚Äôre basically equal. 
4079  ‚Äú-The Corleone Family was like the Roman Empire.-Yeah, it once was.‚ÄùEl Padrino es considerada por muchos la mejor pel√≠cula de todos los tiempos. Tiene un guion perfecto, una direcci√≥n y actuaciones impecables, decenas de momentos memorables, y se ha vuelto una parte gigantesca ya no solo del cine, sino de la cultura en general‚Ä¶El Padrino 2, es eso y m√°s.Esta es de esas contadisimas excepciones en las que la secuela supera a la original.

4082  Vielleicht hatte ich einen schlechten Tag, eventuell war ich nicht konzentrieet genug, aber obwohl ich Der Pate II nun endlich mal auf der gro√üen Leinwand gesehen habe, zusammen mit dem lieben Nenad, muss ich konstatieren, dass der zweite Teil, w√§hrend ich den ersten immer genialer finde, nun viel eingeb√º√üt hat.W√§hrend der erste Teil einen unvergesslichen Moment nach dem n√§chsten m√ºhelos zaubert, hatte ich wirklich nicht auf dem Schirm, wie viel wirklich Langweiliges und relativ Austauschbares in Der Pate II¬†die‚Ä¶  
4083  There‚Äôs a lot that has been said about the entire series that it just becomes silly to reiterate what has been stated beautifully multiple times before.¬†I have come to the conclusion that people who regard The Godfather series to be boring have not completely understood the purpose or the heart behind this film and it‚Äôs characters. Even if that‚Äôs not the case and someone were to still find it beyond boring and unreasonably long, then to them I would‚Ä¶  
4084 The flashback ending is great and really puts both films in perspective. I prefer the 1st film. The acting in Pt 2 is so high level, Pacino and De Niro at the top of their game. Many people seem to come to love Pt.2 more than the original over time, I guess we will see down the road if I feel the same.

4088 As the music faded in from that black screen, I knew I was watching a masterpiece. Everything in this film is near-perfect. What's left to say that hasn't been said a million times before? I'd die for this film.

4090 Not one mention of gabagool smh. Anyways good sequel. I remember Shorsey showing us bit and pieces of this in Gangsters wars lol. Liked the change between Vito and Mikey throughout the film. Couldn't have a mafia film without Robert Di Niro in it. 
4091 Felt very different to the first one which maybe made me like it slightly more? I felt like I was watching something important, not because of the film's actual historical significance but because the way the story is told makes you feel like it is important. I really enjoyed the dual storyline in this too. Cathartic ending, that feeling when you were supposed to be something so great and you couldn't ever really pull it off. Weirdly relatable. I come away from these movies humming that beautiful theme music. 
4092  Miles better than The Godfather Part I in pretty much every way. Maybe it's because I watched it over the course of 3 days, giving it more room to linger, but I enjoyed Part II way more than the first one.The journey it takes you on; showing how the young Vito starts the family, and Michael turns it into a business. Betraying those whom you hold closest for the sake of temporary gain, ultimately leading to internal emptiness. It's‚Ä¶  
4093 Is it hard to write a review of this movie because everything worthwhile one could say about it has already been said, or because it's just so good that you're kind of just speechless? Same thing goes for the first one btw. 
4094 Watching this in a world with both Paddington 2 and Shrek 2 makes it all the more depressing when thinking how much awards ceremonies such as the Oscars like to proclaim themselves 
4095  Guys, don‚Äôt call me crazy, I know this is a hot take, but I think that is one of the best movies of all time.Nah but in all seriousness what is there to say about this that hasn‚Äôt been said. I went into this film fully open minded, fully ready to form my own opinion and not listen to everyone else but man‚Ä¶ there is most definitely a reason that this is known as the best.Absolute masterpiece without‚Ä¶  
4096  Its not often that a sequel can live up to the first film in a franchise it would be especially hard to make one that can live up to the godfather but Francis Ford Coppola manages to do so in such an impressive way, this isn‚Äôt one of those sequels that takes everything from the original and just does it again which he very well could have do just with Micheal being the new godfather but that wouldn‚Äôt be even‚Ä¶

4100 yeah it's an incredible sequel about betrayal and trauma and greed, how a man can want so desperately to become something that his hunger drives him in the opposite direction but robert de niro speaking italian was perhaps the greatest thing i've ever been given the chance to witness. watch out for when i watch this sober and with subtitles because maybe i'll like this even more but for the most part yeah i was drooling over pacino and missing my boy sonny

4102  Let me get this out of the way. This film is the best sequel of all time! I imagine if social media were a thing back in early 70s, the news of a sequel to the cinematic masterpiece that was the first Godfather would‚Äôve created a fire storm on twitter! The plot of The Godfather Part II resembles that of a grand American classic. Not only is it lengthier than its predecessor, but its reach is also far wider. The‚Ä¶

4104  Hard to believe this didn't click with me previously. I liked it, but couldn't understand its reputation as the "best" Godfather film. Previously, the De Niro dominant scenes held little for me, whereas this time they were almost as engaging as the main storyline. De Niro subtly portrays his character in a way that makes it feel natural to associate young Vito with Brando Vito, and I was much more receptive to the role that these segments play thematically.

Com uma est√≥ria que alterna entre duas linhas temporais, o filme mostra a ascens√£o de Vito Corleone interpretado por Robert De Niro como o poderoso chefe da m√°fia na Nova Iorque dos anos 20, e acompanha o seu filho Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) nos anos 50,‚Ä¶  
4108 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  I think arguably this is just as good as the first one, every scene with Robert De Niro as young Vito Corleone were definitely the best part from the whole film besides the scene where Michael gives his brother the Sicilian kiss of death, part II 100% had better pacing because this didn‚Äôt feel like 3 hours and 20 minutes.

No words would truly be enough to describe how much The Godfather means to me personally nor explain how good this film really is but I‚Äôll attempt a brief review nevertheless.Coppola‚Äòs use of the parallel action technique to simultaneously contrast Michael and Vito‚Äôs lives by switching between different time periods was masterfully executed and portrayed. The expert direction, Gordon Willis‚Äôs cinematography and Nino Rota‚Äôs engrossing score allowed the intercut narrative‚Ä¶

4131  I think what happened here is they identified parts of the first movie that made it a hit and those happened to not be the parts I appreciated about it most.¬†They did this sequel emphasizing things like the dark & brooding atmosphere, the intensity of Pacino's character and the allure of learning more about the borderline-mythical Brando character, but they did so at the expense of pace and intriguing plot.¬†Putting two 90-minute movies together the way they did meant‚Ä¶

4143  In interweaving the stories of Michael Corleone and his father Vito in the way it does, The Godfather: Part II makes for a striking example of world-building. Subtle devices like the transition shots of onrushing trains - taking us from one era to the next - is economically done and gives the film a seamless flow.

These movies are so well made that I wasn't bored at all for three and a half hours!The parallels between this and Part I were very clear to me, and were brilliantly executed as well.

4156 The Godfather: Part II - Sicilian Boogaloo. Essentialist filmmaking. Strips the first movie down to its centralized best working components and truly moves in on character development and a non-linear progression of a family‚Äôs history. Remarkable how perfectly it all works in concert. 
4157 "It's not easy being his son." 
4158 Michael‚Äôs timeline is a worthy sequel to the first and is equally amazing. It features some of Pacino‚Äôs best acting ever and giving more screen time to John Cazale is always a good idea. But, they could get rid of all of that and just have Vito‚Äôs timeline in olden days New York and I‚Äôd still love this movie. The sights, the sounds, the language, all of it is perfect. 
4159 Such a deeply emotional experience, one I wasn't expecting since I thought the first godfather was great but just that.Also, Harry Dean Stanton is in this, I always forget he's dead, it almost seems unreal. He has a very small part in this film but he still adds so much, he really was a legend. 
4160 no, they can't never make a film like this again. 
4161  THE GODFATHER, PART II, is often cited as the perfect example of a sequel that exceeded the original. ¬†I fear that I can‚Äôt agree. ¬†For me, the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù example would be STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN. ¬†¬† ¬†¬†That is not to say that THE GODFATHER, PART II is not an excellent movie. ¬†It is. ¬†In fact, I think that the over arching theme is much stronger in the sequel. ¬†But, the story just flowed in THE‚Ä¶

4165 The storytelling in this was truly poetic in the sense of its cinematic impact and acclaim. It was able to capture so much emotion within every character and convey their feelings perfectly. Seeing the contrast of Michael compared to his father set the whole tone and gave a lot to interpret about the whole film. The stunning visuals and cinematography was used brilliantly as a backdrop to divert away from the chaos happening all throughout. This is a masterpiece that still has yet to be topped in many of the areas it strived in.

4170  The main reason why Godfathers I and II work so well is because they are both gripping dramas, populated with memorable characters and punctuated with superlative set-pieces. You don‚Äôt have to like or approve of any of these characters, of course, but you do have to *feel* something for them or, at least, be engaged by them. Coppola achieves this admirably.There are so many stand-out performances in The Godfather Part II but Robert DeNiro deserves particular praise for his,‚Ä¶  
4171  Immaculately made, brilliantly performed... truly top tier filmmaking... yet I couldn't help yearning for the original: a film in many ways simpler and smaller, yet so much more interesting as a singular character study over one specific, narrower story.

4194 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Poor Fredo  
4195 I've made fun of the Academy before, but I must say that they got it right in regards to this film's cinematography. I'm glad they ignored this and its predecessor's utterly pedestrian image-making in favor of some more deserving films. Because while this film's cinematography will be utterly forgotten by time, the images of that year's Best Cinematography winner, The Towering Inferno, will live forever. 
4196 I watched The Godfather eight years ago for the first time. I've put off viewing the sequel since, but I think I've watched it at the perfect time for me. Rarely has a film kept me so engrossed, let alone one with a three and a half hour runtime. I always felt like I was missing something with Part I. It's undeniably a great film but I can't connect with it and I feel the pacing is off. Part II is an improvement in nearly all regards. One of the greatest cinematic pieces I've seen. 
4197  ‚ÄúI know it was you Fredo, you broke my heart‚ÄùWhat better way to see this absolute masterpiece for the 1st time then seeing it on the big screen for its 50th Anniversary.¬†With the 1st film being one of the most perfect films of all time, I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm saying this was even better. Arguably the greatest sequel ever made. No not even arguably, guaranteed the best sequel ever madeIt‚Äôs almost incomprehensible how Coppola managed to transport you‚Ä¶

4199  Going to see "Barbie" yesterday reminded me that my wife Robin had never seen THE GODFATHER PART II. I couldn't wait to show it to her and tell her what she thought of it.

I do believe that the original "The Godfather" is a string of iconic scenes,‚Ä¶  
4200 Love how the Godfather films double as the best Bugsy Siegel/Meyer Lansky biopics out there.¬†This thing moves so well for 3:20; the first hour in particular absolutely flies by.It‚Äôs so insane that Coppola made his masterpiece(s) his early 30s; most every other legendary director‚ÄìSpielberg, Scorsese, Wilder, Kubrick‚Äìdidn‚Äôt attain theirs until their 40s. So excited we're getting a new Francis Ford Coppola movie this year; sometimes our timeline isn‚Äôt so bad.

4217 Consegue alcan√ßar o mesmo n√≠vel de excel√™ncia do primeiro! Toda a trama que envolve Michael e Fredo √© emocionalmente intensa e pesada. Ainda mais pelo amargo desfecho dessa hist√≥ria."Voc√™ partiu o meu cora√ß√£o, Fredo" - esse talvez seja o momento mais ic√¥nico de toda a trilogia. Nesse segundo filme vemos Michael Corleone muito mais aprofundando em suas pr√≥prias trevas. Brilhante tamb√©m a ideia de nos mostrar a trajet√≥ria de Vito desde a inf√¢ncia at√© a fase adulta. Todo o paralelo entre a hist√≥ria dele com a de Michael √© tocante, enquanto um construiu toda uma fam√≠lia, o outro a destruiu. 
4218 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   There are two distinct moments that really strike a chord. When Michael Corleone tells Tom Hagen that they are brothers and he's the only one he can trust and Michael realizing Fredo betrayed him by inadvertently admitting he actually did know Johnny Ola. Pacino in both scenes, and when Michael anticipates being assassinated, telling Fredo at a cafe table, the two reunited in Cuba, is simply a made actor. No melodramatics, just intense emotional quiet, smoldering and right there in‚Ä¶

4224  Es ist maximal beeindruckend, mit was f√ºr einer Selbstverst√§ndlichkeit Coppola den in Teil 1 noch so sorgf√§ltig aufgebauten Pathos dekonstruiert. Man kann dieses Unterfangen ohne zu √ºbertreiben als tollk√ºhn bezeichnen.

On the other hand it cannot stand alone, the first is essential to this film, but this is an essential part to the first. They work perfectly together. I don't think I need to explain why I love this film, it's infinitely exceptional in every aspect. The ending of this film is the most perfect scene in cinema. It literally does not get better than that.

4234  The Godfather told the story of a powerful crime family and the passing down of its legacy. Part 2 chronicles the path towards full legitimisation and the challenges that come with existing in an increasingly capitalist world. Relations are strained, deals are broken and nothing is ever as straightforward as it seems. Different times call for different, more radical measures. We follow the continuation of Michael's story from where part 1 left off, while also taking a look back into‚Ä¶

4236  A visually stunning picture with a dual-narrative and superlative score, The Godfather Part II is definitely one of the best films ever made. I find that the first installment is my preference though after seeing them back to back. Part II certainly has a larger scope. I found myself more interested in the Vito Corleone storyline than Michael‚Äôs. Michael‚Äôs storyline starts to build on Shakespearean cliches. Court rooms, betrayal, family turmoil, and lots of dialogue.¬†Another subtle difference is the‚Ä¶

4240 Ate some Italian food and watched this with my family. Having to pause the movie every 30 mins to explain what was happening to my mother, and my grandmother constantly spoiling twists because she read the book, kinda ruined the pacing, but besides that it was good. 
4241 Man, I am so pissed at myself not re-watching this as frequently as the first one. There's a lot to say about this but what seriously blew me away this time around was the acting, *that* scene between Pacino and Keaton is probably their best work. S+ cinema.

4251 There we go, much more aesthetically sound. And I just thought this was way better than the first. 
4252 Rewatching this made me appreciate this film even more. I already knew it was a masterpiece but now I realise how challenging this film was to make. To have two storylines playing simultaneously and both be equally as interesting is quite incredible and no film does it better than this one. The directly contrasting stories of Michael and Vito give this film an extra depth over the first one for me. It may be unpopular but for me Part 2 edges Part 1 because of this, although both films are deserving of their reputation as undebatable masterpieces of American cinema. 
4253  While we all agree that the first film in this franchise is and will always be a magnificent piece of cinema in all its entirety, this second feature precedes the realms of sequels and prequels to a whole new ambitious level, something that is completely on a league of its own and can withstand the test of time. It‚Äôs that good. This film unravelled what a true acting prowess Al Pacino is, delving extensively into his character‚Äôs fall from grace,‚Ä¶  
4254  A masterful sequel that is every bit the equal to its predecessor, Part II of the Corleone saga is an even denser and more complex proposition than Part I, continuing the story thread of Michael's attempts to take the family business in a legitimate direction but very much laying bare just how much the story is really about the darker underbelly of the American dream.1974 was one hell of a year for Coppola what with this and The Conversation,‚Ä¶  
4255 Al Pacino ? More like Al Paci-yes. 
4256 I only knew a pivotal line in this movie due to its use in Billy Madison. 
4257 not as good as the first one but it is a great sequel to a good movie 
4258 Continuar uma obra perfeita √© realmente dif√≠cil, mas Coppola conseguiu, ‚ÄúPoderoso chef√£o parte II‚Äù √© um filme brilhante, que consegue ir al√©m e aprofundar com total seguran√ßa a sua hist√≥ria, com uma fotografia sublime, os elementos de tela as caracter√≠sticas dos personagens, os figurantes, tudo contrasta e enriquece com a cena, e a trilha sonora √© algo magnifico, todo elenco merece ressalvas, mas a performance ic√¥nica do Al Pacino √© algo inesquec√≠vel, realmente uma obra-prima inabal√°vel. 
4259  There are a million things I could comment about how this film is the best one in the trilogy, but right now I just want to express how perfect the whole Cuba sequence is. It illustrates perfectly the way the powerful men, criminal or otherwise, of the United States, look at it, and at all of Latin America. They want us to be their little orchard/vacation resort, and sadly there is always a Batista or a Bolsonaro who will happily‚Ä¶  
4260 I guess you can say I‚Äôm a ‚Äúfan‚Äù of ‚Äúcinema‚Äù üëª 
4261 Now I‚Äôll just pee in this movie :X I AM SOOOOOO SORRY 
4262 Despite its lack of Brando, I can‚Äôt decide on whether or not it‚Äôs better than the first.Pacino is just as great, the plot is as complex and the overall craftsmanship of it is amazing. Just a great sequel and possibly the greatest double feature.

4265  A messy film. It still holds the same beautiful visuals and performances of the original, with the broad, expansive sweeping narrative, but it ultimately feels trapped by the story it wants to tell.This feels like two pretty interesting films sewn into one. A prequel, about Vito Corleone and his reluctant early rise. And a sequel about what comes next for Michael Corleone. But the Michael story has little connectivity. It's a series of vignettes or interesting scenes bookended by‚Ä¶  
4266 "I don't want anything to happen to him while my mother is alive" damn that was stone cold 
4267  The first Godfather, the one that started it all, is a masterpiece in every single way. It's almost magical, as if a kind grandfather is telling you a bedtime story, only that story is full of bloodshed and tears.Here, in what is widely considered the best sequel of all-time and one of the finest movies ever made, we get 2 stories, one about Vito Corleone's early days in America, and Michael's story about his struggles in the family business.‚Ä¶  
4268 I never would have thought DeNiro would work as Vito Corleone, but fucking damn it, he crushed it to pieces. While no one can ever top Brando in the part, DeNiro definitely did the character justice, and the flashback-scenes were for me the absolute highlights, in an otherwise amazing movie. 
4269  "If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill anyone."It's become a bit of a cliche at this point to say THE GODFATHER: PART II is one of the greatest sequels ever made. However, living in this current age of Hollywood franchises with endless sequels rehashing the same story into the ground, this film still stands strong. It really does feel like an organic continuation of the first film, so‚Ä¶  
4270 While I still prefer its predecessor, "The Godfather Part II" is a beautifully crafted piece of filmmaking with brilliant direction, complex writing, and nuanced performances. This film is even more dense than the first one, yet it's always engaging. 
4271  A stirring continuation of the Corleone family started in the 1972 original, Godfather part two follows Vito Corleone's (DeNiro) rise to power along with Michael's(Pacino)descent into the dark mob world mentality and may actually be better than the original that is so iconic in its own right. Gordon Willis's cinematography is breathtaking and the music from Nino Rota just breaths life into every scene, but the power of Pacino's performance is the driving force of the film and his essence‚Ä¶  
4272 this shit? 
4273  A powerful sequel that stands up to its iconic predecessor with its inventive storytelling and darker content.As seemingly impossible as it was to follow up one of the greatest films ever made, Coppola does that and some more. With a complex screenplay that juggles the past and the present and tells the story of Vito Corleone's rise to power intertwined with Michael's fall from grace, The Godfather Part II is a more challenging watch, to be fair.It starts‚Ä¶  
4274 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   The Godfather: Part II is my all time favourite film. The idea of reviewing it is daunting to me, how can I do this monumental piece of work justice with mere words? How can I review this movie without reviewing the first part? I should probably start with a recap. The Godfather revolves around the Corleone family, a powerful Mafia family set-up in New York. The family is headed up by The Godfather 'Don' Vito Corleone who has three sons‚Ä¶   
4275  Encore un chef d‚Äô≈ìuvre sign√© Francis Ford Coppola, une suite parfaite qui est tout aussi bien que le 1er.

4276  The Godfather: Part II is notably one of the most iconic projects and deemed by many as the ‚Äúbest film of all time‚Äù. That being said, I was ultimately so disappointed by this on many levels.The pacing of this film was so atrocious and I‚Äôve seen a handful of my mutuals say the same thing which makes me feel a bit better. This dragged so incredibly hard and at times I wanted to just turn it off. I mean,‚Ä¶  
4277 ‚Äúthe corleone family is LIKE the roman empire‚Äù ???it IS my roman empire 
4278 Without a doubt, my biggest wish for 2024 is that Megalopolis turns out to be great. I need at least one certified Coppola banger released in my lifetime. 
4279 Among the very best-looking movies ever made by an American studio, though it narratively falters slightly compared to the original. The De Niro half is solid gold and as great as anything in the first, but Pacino‚Äôs sections feel a little more meandering and unwieldy, which makes the overall endeavor feel less cohesive than the original. And it‚Äôs a shame that Marlon Brando, James Caan, and so many of the supporting players from the first were narratively required to leave a gaping hole in this one, as their absence makes the atmosphere feel lonelier and emptier, which I suppose is fitting.

4282  Finally watched this.I‚Äôll admit I don‚Äôt have a ton to say about it that hasn‚Äôt been said already other than that I do prefer the first over it. This is fantastic film but I do think it lacks in some of its pacing. It‚Äôs 3 and a half hours long and I do think it could‚Äôve been shortened a tad. I also feel that the Robert De Niro plot line was not as interesting as the Al Pacino one,‚Ä¶  
4283 I know it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart. You broke my heart!Happy new year! 
4284  Wow. Blown away by the rewatch. I think the first time I watched this I was caught up in the thick plot, which follows two storylines and is a great deal heavier than the first, that I was unable to fully appreciate Part II for what it is.Part II is a masterclass in filmmaking. The score, acting, cinematography, storyline. Everything is rich and full. This is decadent, yet depressing filmmaking at its very finest.I was impressed most by‚Ä¶  
4285 Oh. That‚Äôs a nice pear I guess. 
4286  If The Godfather was about how the pursuit of power would corrupt you (and I'm not sure it is, as it ain't like Michael started out with nothing like his old man, but that's an argument for another time, when I haven't been drinking since the first frame of the first flick), then The Godfather Part II asks what you horrors you would do to keep it once you have it. It's there from the beginning, where Don Ciccio is‚Ä¶

4295 READ HEREboxd.it/gSozrThe plot twist is DEVASTATING. 
4296 I'll lay it out simple:The Godfather: Part II is the finest Mafia film. Ever.100/100 
4297 I don't know what it is.I certainly appreciate the scope and quality of the storytelling in these movies, but I can just never seem to connect with them on an emotional level. They're drier than the Antarctic desert to me. It's in the characters, or the writing, or something, but I can't pin it down. It just doesn't click for me.And you know what? I'm not ashamed to feel this way about these movies. I am what I am. 
4298 Gun to my head I go Part I. I hope that gun ain't loaded though because it's one of the toughest calls there is.One of the greatest looking films of all time, no question. The De Niro part looks unreal. I wish he got a little more screen time but other than that I have no complaints. 200 minutes fly by in an hour. It's incredible. 
4299 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   "Fredo, You're Nothing To Me Now. You're Not A Brother, You're Not A Friend."The Godfather 2 is a sequel that is legitimately equally as masterful as its predecessor. While I‚Äôll most likely always have the first one right above it, you could argue choosing between the two is like parents picking their favorite child. Great Mob movies tend to leave a significant impact on me as they are a genre I find myself so engrossed in and it all‚Ä¶   
4300 i changed my mind after a rewatch, this film is on par with the original, i still think the og is better but this one is by far not a 3/5, Robert De niro for me is the stand out as Vito Corleone in this film, every time he‚Äôs in screen he keeps me hooked, he perfected the mannerisms of Marlon Brandos‚Äô Vito Corleone. 
4301 i know it was you, fredo. you broke my heart. you broke my heart. 
4302 i still love being sicilian but let‚Äôs talk about young deniro‚Ä¶ 
4303 been feeling like absolute shit with this cold the last 2 days, but i think this movie may be better than the first time i watched this, but idk i still prefer the first over pt 2 which i know isn‚Äôt a controversial take, but al pacino is just incredible in this 
4304 happy new year my american friends!!!!!!! may you have vito‚Äôs confidence‚Ä¶ kay‚Äôs sense of fashion‚Ä¶ michael‚Äôs audacity‚Ä¶ and fredo‚Äôs lust for life ‚ù§Ô∏è 
4305 unpopular opinion: the godfather¬†>¬†the godfather part 2the godfather (1972), to me at least, was the story of an innocent boy turning corrupt and into the person he swore not to be. the godfather part 2 (1974) felt like world building, which, for some of the movie would be great but then we need an exciting plot. the plot of this was enjoyable but it did not hold my interest for the entire runtime. therefore, the godfather part 2 is, in my opinion, the inferior godfather movie. 
4306 Personally I prefer part 1, but damn what movie. 
4307 I still give the nod to the first, which didn't have to juggle all that was left from the book with a new story (both still very good!), but this also benefits from 200 percent even more Pacino, 300 percent more Cazale, and nthousand percent more Robert De Niro and Harry Dean Stanton. The zoom-in on that Lake Tahoe motorboat as a prayer is said for the last shred of Michael Corleone's soul is my favorite scene from either. 
4308 I'm glad, that I finally watched these two films, even when this second part was a bit harder to endure, just because of its length. However, I enjoyed every scene of it, especially the De Niro timeline but also Pacino gave a brilliant performance again. Still, the first part seemed to be a little smoother in my eyes.My Untouchables 
4309 Es una gran pel√≠cula, eso no lo voy a poner en duda pero disfrut√© mucho m√°s la primera parte 
4310 9.4/10This second film is very good, but for me the first film is still a little above this. I liked the part when Vito Corleone was young. Very interesting and Robert De Niro's acting is amazing. The whole film is very good, the acting of each actor is very good and of course Al Pacino managed to play his role well. 
4311  So I finally got around to watching it!!!I didn‚Äôt love it as much as part one but that might be to do with seeing pt 1 at the cinema and this one on my laptop. Perhaps my rating would be higher if i saw it at the cinema as it certainly helps me concentrate more, and i hope to rewatch it there some day.Robert De Niro is fantastic. I had no idea he doesn‚Äôt even speak english in‚Ä¶

4314 My godI get it now 
4315 The Godfather: Part II has duplicate elements from the first part + redundant subplot with Robert De Niro, but fortunately the whole thing is more focused on Michael's relationships with family members ‚Äî that is the essence of this part. 
4316 this was literally a masterpiece and al pacino and robert de niro where fine as fuck 
4317 "Why didn't we spend time like this before?"So Al Pacino as Michael Corleone has to be one of the greatest lead performances ever put to film right? Right?!?There's a great tragedy to the character and Pacino's dead-behind-the-eyes performance REALLY works wonders to help us feel the weight of that - dude is just phenomenal...I'm not yet comfortable in saying it's better than the first, but I get it... truly as good as a sequel can get. Those final few shots in particular... *bellissimo* 
4318 ‚Äúi know it was you fredo, you broke my heart, you broke my heart‚Äùo grande ponto alto desse aqui √© a hist√≥ria do vito corleone, mas o enredo do michael √© sensacional tamb√©m

4323  Not as good as the first in my opinion, but this movie has something the first one doesn‚Äôt: DeNiro. Simply put, Don Vito‚Äôs origin on screen is what carries this film. To this film‚Äôs credit, the present-time events of the movie are incredibly intense and volatile, and the film in general is more multilayered and subtextual than the first. However, I think there are an abundance of memorable and climactic scenes in the first movie that you don‚Äôt really get‚Ä¶  
4324 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  came here only to gloat. my parents have seen this 50 times and on a first watch tn I caught the orange symbolism. merry chrysler!  
4325  The story picks up a few years after the point at which the first part ends. Michael (Al Pacino) is a feared and respected Don, who tries to follow in his father's footsteps and make the family business come out of hiding and become legal. For this, his efforts are focused on conquering the east coast of the USA, abandoning smuggling and controlling Las Vegas casinos once and for all. In parallel to Michael's narrative, we have the origin of‚Ä¶  
4326  Godfather part 2 absolute masterpiece¬†Some people say this is better than the first godfather but I Disagree this movie has better directing and story telling but Marlon Brandos performance in the first make it number 1 for me but this is still fantastic¬†Obviously the acting is superb and Al pachino constantly shows why he‚Äôs one of the best and same goes to Robert di Niro¬†I loved the story line of a young Vito I found that more‚Ä¶  
4327  you know a film is old when it has an intermission‚Ä¶..anyway, al pacino brooding for three hours was very comforting to me <3young robert de niro‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ ¬†spare hand in marriage sir? ü•∫when fredo corleone said ‚ÄúI'm your older brother, Mike, and I was stepped over!‚Äù, an angel gained its wings. but poor fredo‚Ä¶..what a great scene! cazale was so underrated.¬†this is superior to the first one in every single way. (i actually tried watching it‚Ä¶  
4328  one thing about michael is that he'll hide his thoughts and emotions within himself, there's a layered mask on his face. you can't know for sure if he's studying their behaviour or if he's just being friendly, nor if he thinks good of them or if he's already preparing to get them assassinated. his quiet aura gives him much power, his eyes tells a story that his enemies aren't able to read. he keeps them relaxed before he finally strikes.‚Ä¶

4330 Juxtaposition con intercutting, molto bene! ü§å 
4331 - The Coppola Restoration - A great movie and all, but ultimately wasn't as good as the first, and DEFINITELY isn't one of the best movies of all time. Still doesn't mean I'm gonna deny how beautifully made it is! Between the story, the writing and the acting, it's amazing. It just wasn't constantly engaging, it was easy for me as a viewer to lose focus and it didn't have as many unforgettable scenes as the first! 
4332 I didn‚Äôt really get into this one that much. Maybe it‚Äôs because my computer has an issue so I‚Äôm gonna get it fixed, but that‚Äôll take at least a week so I can‚Äôt use for at least a week so I was in a bad mood and that might be why I didn‚Äôt like this too¬†much. Again, I still enjoyed it, but not nearly as much as the first one. It‚Äôs really fucking long. Not a necessarily a bad thing, but like Jesus this is long. I am excited for the third one for a plethora of reasons. 
4333 why don‚Äôt men look like 70s al pacino and robert de niro anymore 
4334  So since I watched the first one yesterday since it is the 50th anniversary of the first one it is only right that I watch the greatest sequel of all time. I can't help but be amazed by the acting in this there are scenes that just blow me away the scene between Al Pacino and Diane Keaton and the scene between Pacino and Cazale just floor me every time even though I have lost count on how many times‚Ä¶  
4335 Continuing my rewatch now that I have the 4K UHD remasters.This one is maybe my favorite of the three‚Ä¶ barely topping the first one. I think the scenes showing young Vito Corleone‚Äôs story really adds layers to the trilogy. And De Niro was just so damn good in the role.I also enjoy watching Michael continue down the road to not only following in his father‚Äôs footsteps, but becoming worse than his father. 
4336 Near perfect, but I had some issues I'll discuss later on my channel. 
4337 Pure genius. I prefer this to the first film. To me, The Godfather features an awesome story and was revolutionary in filmmaking, while The Godfather: Part II features an "awesome-er" story, was even more revolutionary in filmmaking, and the deep themes were way richer. This is my new favorite mob movie.

4339  Im KinoIch vergesse immer wieder, wie gut dieser Film ist. Das Schauspiel, die Kulisse, das Pacing und der absolut legend√§re Soundtrack. Robert De Niro spielt Vito Corleone so gut, dass man Marlon Brando garnicht vermisst. Trotzdem bevorzuge ich weiterhin, Mr. Brando als Don Vito Corleone.Al Pacino spielt grandios und ich sag es immer wieder, die wohl beste Performance. Es war grandios auch diesen Film, auf der Leinwand zu sehen. Bei vielen Szenen, kriegt man auch immer noch G√§nsehaut.‚Ä¶  
4340  Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.Re-release in the cinema. Imagine making one of the best films ever made and then you make a sequel that‚Äôs on par if not better. Coppola outdid himself here with creating a prequel/sequel, it‚Äôs like he made two films with this one film. Along with that, due to not getting the role of Sonny in The first Godfather, he casted Robert De Niro as a younger Vito Corleone (a stroke of genius)‚Ä¶  
4341 P E R F E C T I O N.After seeing both in the cinema, I‚Äôve decided I like this one more. Formally it‚Äôs right on par, but having the noble rise of Vito AND the soul-crushing fall of Michael interspersed into ONE MOVIE.. just too beautiful.I BELIEVE IN POETIC CINEMA! 
4342  traditional values crumbling under the influence of power and greed, making room for ruthless ideals. deeply sad, much better than the first, utilizes its runtime much better despite being longer, every scene builds on the film's themes. both narratives complement each other perfectly, very glad that it doesn't indulge in relentless cutting back and forth between vito's and michael's story to needlessly emphatize parallels between them which i feel most director's would've done but taking time for long chunks of‚Ä¶  
4343 ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom. Just my enemies, that‚Äôs all.‚ÄùNo doubt a masterpiece, perhaps even on par with its predecessor, but personally I vastly prefer the original Godfather. It‚Äôs story feels tight and focused whereas this film can sometimes get lost in its own scope and nonlinear story. But that‚Äôs just my two cents on the matter.Naturally I should watch part 3 next, but honestly I don‚Äôt feel quite brave enough to revisit it just yet. 
4344 ‚Äúwhy do you hurt me, michael?‚Äùthere are few things more devastating than the cut from fredo‚Äôs arms holding his baby brother tight to pacino‚Äôs blank expression looking down at him, barely containing the wounded, angry person trying to hug him back. 
4345 im a simple girl, you give me Robert De Niro looking sexy speaking Italian, I give you a high rating. 
4346  Michael Corleone: I've always taken care of you Fredo.Fredo Corleone: Taken care of me? You're my kid brother and you take care of me? Did you ever think about that, huh? Did you ever ONCE think about that? "Send Fredo off to do this; Send Fredo off to do that." "Let Fredo take care of some Mickey Mouse nightclub somewhere." "Send Fredo to pick somebody up at the airport." I'm your older brother Mike and I was stepped over.‚Ä¶  
4347 It does not insist upon itself.Setting aside that this a masterpiece with fantastic direction, writing, and cinematography, this is Al Pacino and Robert De Niro showing off the full range of what they‚Äôre capable of as performers. My only real gripes here relate to the flashback sequences with De Niro as Vito, which are spectacular in a vacuum, but feel largely disconnected from the rest of the film, and aren‚Äôt integrated into it very well. 
4348 Wayyyy better than the first one. Michael Corleone‚Äôs character development is perfect also I loved seeing the early life of Don Vito Corleone. Amazing sets, acting, story and more. 
4349  Of course I‚Äôm blown away at the stunning visuals, the emotional thematic mastery of story telling on display. But for the first time rewatching this I found myself asking ‚ÄúIs it possible the sequel is actually better than the original‚Äù? ¬†Knowing full well the former pioneered new roads into the gangster genre we still see bearing fruit today. Could it be a continuation, a launching point with which new heights were reached because of the greatness surrounding Coppola‚Äôs brave, ambitious‚Ä¶  
4350  Francis Ford Coppola's follow-up to the original Godfather is a deep, thematically-driven, and enthralling masterpiece that defies odds to prove it's the best sequel known to mankind. Now, I didn't really "loved" the original as much as people did, but this sequel just gave everything, technical or substance, to deliver such storylines that will not just serve viewers, but to also influence generations to come. Coppola's work on fleshing out Vito Corleone and Michael Corleone is nothing but pure ingenious,‚Ä¶  
4351 It‚Äôs probably controversial but I much preferred this film over The Godfather part 1.Robert De Niro‚Äôs portrayal of a young Vito was very good and I enjoyed those scenes very much.Al Pacino really should‚Äôve won the Oscar for this film. 
4352 My father‚Äôs name was Antonio Andolini, and this is for you. 
4353 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Great acting, incredible music, amazing writing, especially with the fantastic characters that have so much relatability and heart- De Niro's character hit me the most, he was a normal guy with a family all before he started stealing and then lost his job, all of which resulting in him killing a Don. He was my favourite character definitely, and everything else compliments this; the lighting and sets are perfect. There are quite a few pacing issues, I think I'll re-watch this next week!  
4354 ‚ÄúTell me something, Ma. What did Papa think, deep in his heart?‚Äùthere‚Äôs a scene in the beginning where Michael is telling connie how she has abandoned her kids and needs to see them and then maybe halfway through there is a scene where Michael sees a toy tom hagen bought for his kid as he walks through an empty house, at that exact point my heart broke into a thousand little pieces.¬†‚Äúyou‚Äôre nothing to me, not a brother, not a friend‚Äù

4359 I just would like to know why¬†Al Pacino did not win an Oscar for this. And yeah, this was just as good as Pt 1. 
4360 While I continue to find the original Godfather incredibly entertaining in addition to being a rich text, Part II is a denser, more complex affair that commands my respect if not the same level of adoration. Still, it feels like a necessary story of how Vito succeeded while Michael ultimately fails‚Äîhe‚Äôs left the king of a hollow kingdom, completely alone after obliterating his family because his transactional worldview only allows him to see enemies.

4373  Que maravilla.El Padrino II es una pel√≠cula sobre las diferencias. Vito, por un lado, construye rode√°ndose de gente, agrandando su familia y gan√°ndose el respeto ajeno. Michael, por el otro, construye un imperio, pero lo hace apart√°ndose de todo tipo de relaciones. Hermanos, amigos, esposa o hijos, no importa qui√©n; Michael queda solo. Para mi la historia se resume en la √∫ltima escena de la pel√≠cula, que arranca con la mesa llena y termina con Michael sentado a solas,‚Ä¶

4375 I can‚Äôt deny that I really miss Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone. The Godfather Part II isn‚Äôt as good as its predecessor, but it‚Äôs still fantastic. Al Pacino really gave this his best and it shows. The change in Michaels character from the first movie to this one is so well done. Stoked for the final piece. 
4376 The greatest film ever made. That's all.Rating: 100/100 
4377 This Vito Corleone dude sure likes to play the long game when it comes to revenge. 
4378 In one scene Al Pacino, without saying a word, exudes pure contempt, disappointment, and menace and all he does is stare and then closes a door. The color palette of his wardrobe like a lion with a scarf mane. The King.Then in 2011 his wardrobe was a 3 piece suit with donuts for Jack and Jill and he sings Dunkacino. 
4379 justice for frankie!!! 
4380 What's remarkable about The Godfather: Part II is how it deepens the story of the Corleone family on both an emotional and personal level. While The Godfather was a crime epic with a strict plot, this sequel serves more as a character study of Michael -- one that is dark, disturbing, and poignant. That's part of the reason why I prefer this film to its predecessor (by the slimmest of margins, mind you).It's also a testament to this team, and to Coppola's direction, that this film is never boring despite its mammoth runtime.And god damn, that final shot. Just perfection. 
4381 ‚ÄúI know it was you Fredo! You broke my heart. You broke my heart!‚Äùexcuse me while i take the rest of my life to process this. probably the best piece of cinema ever made. wow. 
4382  AFI 100 Greatest Films - #32Francis Ford Coppola created an absolutely beautiful epic that I was thankful to see on the big screen for the first time with this viewing. The story is exceptionally woven, famously using flashbacks, between the early life of Don Vito and the current life of his son, and heir, Michael and in doing so created an example of one of the best paced 180 minute plus movies ever made. The period detail is so‚Ä¶  
4383 ‚ÄúI don't feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom. Just my enemies.‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to say. This is simply my new favorite film. I‚Äôm at a loss for words. I was moved several times during this masterpiece just by how perfect it was. It‚Äôs seriously that good. That great. It‚Äôs my favorite film of all time. Plain and simple. 
4384 "Bello, bello e impossibileCon gli occhi neri e la tua bocca da baciareBello, bello e invincibile."Alora, Gianna Nannini, did she write that song actually for Al Pacino? Ma certo! 
4385 Annual viewing. The older I get, the more this separates from the first Godfather. Probably the closest to Shakespeare we‚Äôre going to get in cinema. Michael Corleone, Charles Foster Kane, Norma Desmond, the Little Tramp ‚Äî short list for greatest cinematic characters? From his introduction at the wedding in Part 1 to where he is at the end of Part 2, Michael has to be number one. That I‚Äôll never write a character this good is both tormenting and liberating. 
4386 The Godfather: Here we go again 
4387 watching this is the best example of why people say that movies make you feel that you're travelling to another reality 
4388 It‚Äôs both brilliant and uncanny how much young De Niro resembles Brando. He deadass looks more like Brando to me than young Brando himself, and even his voice is kinda reminiscent of the Godfather‚Äôs iconic one. Perhaps one of the greatest casting choices ever. 
4389 whoops 
4390 Marvelous. Still very drawn to the immigrant story with young Vito (DeNiro). And told in parallel to Michael's story as a first generation child slowly destroying his family. I genuinely believe it is the greatest migrant story put to film. 
4391 A worthy sequel that stands on its own without the formidable backbone of the first film. It's excellent in its own right but it's strange to me that people see this as one of the best films ever, or even better than the first. I can't think of a single aspect of the film that was better in Part 2 (except maybe Pacino's performance but that's debatable). Not to say anything was bad, far from it. Everything was actually fantastic, just always a nudge below the first. 
4392 If you cut out all of the long silences and awkward staring this film would be like 30 minutes long 
4393 The Godfather casting was out of this world, It actually had brilliant star cast and all of them delivered their best performance that's unlikely to see in modern age where stars can perform as good as these all did in past.  The Godfather had Al pacino, De niro, Robert duvall, diane Keaton, john cazale, james caan & of course Marlon legend Brando.  As it was a reunion for The Godfather casts I just had to go back and watch all three movies. Second installment of the series was the best, it sets the bar high. Happy Reunion.Thank You, sir Francis Coppola. 
4394 This is as good as The Godfather in nearly every aspect. The one thing that's sorely missed is Brando's Vito Corleone. That commanding, yet gentle character added an extra dimension to the film that made it something special. Though De Niro does a great job playing a younger Vito, it's just not the same. Brando's absence doesn't diminish everyone else's excellent performances, including one of Pacino's career highlights, so there's still much to love about this film. 
4395 the parallel stories between Vito Corleone and his son Michael Corleone as godfathers were effortlessly and magnificently told. 
4396  The Godfather: Part II works to cement the themes and concerns of its predecessor, and telescoping the story of the Corleone family in each direction makes the first film even stronger in retrospect. Reverberations of the first film begin to appear immediately, with the opening taking place during a lavish family celebration, the patriarch presiding over business affairs, and continues with loyalties tested and retributions made over a very detailed and specific series of events. Like his father, Michael begins‚Ä¶  
4397 Can a sequel be better than the original? This one is the best answer you could ever hope for. 
4398  There is no doubt that this is probably the best sequel ever made, it really does live up to that hype. It's also just a really great film in general, sequel or not. This time we are awarded with two stories to follow, one that takes place during the present and the other during the past. It is really hard for me to choose whether I like Part II or the original Godfather more but there is no doubt that‚Ä¶  
4399  The 'godfather' was only ever Don Vito Corleone. Portrayed by two of the best ever, Brando and De Niro, the titular figure looms over everything, and he always has. When Michael assumes the role of Don over his family, he doesn't become the Godfather: he merely becomes the new man in charge. Vito Corleone's influence extends so far over this saga that a significant amount of time in PART II is spent as a sort-of 'prequel', dating all the way‚Ä¶  
4400 Six hours and two masterworks later, I feel honored to have experienced my first time with The Godfather: Part II in an actual multiplex, and with a restored 35mm to top it all off. Bless you, Regal Cinemas. 
4401  "If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it is that you can kill anyone." - Michael CorleoneGeorge R.R. Martin, take note. For The Godfather Part II is a landmark, both of cinema and influences on popular culture. It is difficult to imagine a world without Part II, as it not only expands on the universe set up gracefully by the first instalment, but also improves on its legendary status. For me, The Godfather‚Ä¶  
4402 10/10this is my favorite one. the beauty of the cinematography, the characters, the impeccable writing, everything is just so masterful. i love this movie so much 
4403 Michael, we're bigger then U.S SteelThe first Godfather and Apocalypse Now are unquestionable masterpieces, but I've come around on Part 2 being Coppolas greatest contribution to cinema. 
4404  I'm ashamed I haven't seen Part 2 since now, but yes, I finally watched this after a year of procrastinating. "You're nothing to me anymore Fredo." When I thought the first Godfather couldn't get any better, I was finally taught that was false.Diving the movie more into Michael Corleone was the right thing to do. There are some movie trilogies and franchises that make them wrong by writing about something different comapred to the Godfather trilogy. This is something‚Ä¶  
4405 Masterpiece 
4406 what a silly lil guy 
4407 Chef's KissKinda not in the mood to write a long review for this one like I did with the previous film but, This is just another masterpiece. It's like on same quality of the first one, Kind of enjoyed the first one more but this movie is just straight phenomenal as well. Can say my favorite parts for example were Young Don Vito Corleone's who was played by Robert De Niro. Kind of tired after staying up for like almost 4 hours to see this, But if one thing, It was worth it. 
4408  theres a history of vengeance that has perpetuated this empire from the start. Michael Corleone has grown out of his once concealed self, now he's become the leader and enforcer [Godfather] to his disciples. as he's always been the most intelligent and perceptive of the bunch.def felt the runtime way more than on Part 1‚Äìhowever, this is still undoubtedly great. it adds way more to the Corleone lore than I thought it needed. it provides more context onto how‚Ä¶  
4409 I found this to be a profoundly different experience to Part 1. I felt after the first one that I had been pulled back to where I should have been initially. It was incredibly captivating and is second only to Goodfellas in the gangster genre for me. 
4410  A perfect sequel to a perfect film. The Godfather: Part 2 doesn't rest on the laurels of its predecessor and tries to pass the time by riffing on the same themes that worked the last time, but it broadens its scope as it tells the story of the generation after Don Vito Corleone, while at the same time relating an origin story back in the day when that term wasn't thrown around yet. In that sense, it is a film‚Ä¶  
4411 My hot take is¬†The Godfather¬†Part II is a better film than the first one, the tragic but inevitable disintegration of the so-called American dream and the family has never been more pronounced than the display here.Added to: Sight and Sound Greatest FilmsAdded to: Francis Ford Coppola, Ranked 
4412 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  I was just kind of watching this again to have something on in the background while I dozed off, and I competently forgot how loud the gunshots were in the scene where Michael's house gets shot. So I was juts about to doze off when the gunshots start piercing into my ears, and I swear my heart has never raced that fast in my entire life. Suffice to say, it scared the hell out of me ü§£ü§£  
4413  So my recent experience of revisiting The Godfather at the cinema, after many years, was lukewarm, but I had a great time with the sequel! Brando‚Äôs absence, and a much more confident Coppola, make a huge difference. I was completely swept up by the story, and was very happy to inhabit this world for the whole of the film‚Äôs epic runtime. A lot of this is due to Gordon Willis‚Äôs cinematography, which struck me as bigger, bolder, warmer, and darker‚Ä¶

4420 Clearly the MAMMA MIA: HERE WE GO AGAIN of the GODFATHER saga. I‚Äôve spent many years convinced that this was the best of the three. Now, I‚Äôm not sure. 1 has the clearer arc and more enduring iconography, but this one is undoubtedly the richer and more ambitious of the films. In the process, though, I feel like some characters from the original are somewhat underserved here (Kay for example actually has more presence in 3 than this one). Still, an exquisite and sprawling work of a master at the height of his powers.

4425  In light of recent controversies, I decided to watch a Coppola film to see if it was as good as a Marvel movie. While The Godfather Part II has its moments, there are certainly many things that could have been done to fit more in line with the MCU aesthetic. First, while Marvel movies have lots of explosions, GF2 only has a grenade go off during the Cuba sequence. Instead of an overabundance of CGI, GF2 has meticulous production design,‚Ä¶

4433 Just incredible stuff. De Niro is so good. I prefer the first film to this, but only by a hair. 
4434 Pacino‚Äôs greatest on screen performance, it‚Äôs the biggest Oscar travesty ever that he didn‚Äôt win.¬†Vito‚Äôs early life is arguably the best part and greatest strength of the film.

4435 it's so dreadful to watch this after part 1. while I think part 1 is more all over the place than part 2 but I can get behind the fact that they are having a side effect on everything, or they are product of every other thing that's happening.in part 2 we have this focused; more political and mystery plot and they can't help themselves to put more things in it.it's like "wow, I finally got on board with narrative after 40 minutes" and boom.let's switch to another story.  truly amazing stuff. 
4436  Many people consider The Godfather Part 2 to be a perfect example of how a sequel can be better than its predecessor. So it was kind of weird that I ended up feeling the opposite.The sequel to Coppola's hit classic follows Michael Corleone's story as he faces challenges ahead of his journey to achieving his father's lost ambition, to be the one to control the strings. It continues the saga with an excellent opening scene that introduces Michael's ambitions‚Ä¶

4458  I used to think 'The Godfather' (1972) didn't need any sequels. Michael's story in this first film is wrapped up perfectly by the time the door closes on Kay. Having rewatched the trilogy multiple times now I think I was wrong. The first movie is showing how Michael becomes a crime lord and Part II (and I guess Part III but I still need to rewatch that one) shows us the consequences of him becoming a crime lord.Part II‚Ä¶  
4459  And I said to myself, this is the business we‚Äôve chosen.First off, I‚Äôve actually heard the braindead take that this sequel is unnecessary and a cash grab which is just wrong because not only are the characters of Vito and Micheal psychologically interesting enough to continue following but also because it‚Äôs a adaptation of the rest of the same fucking book the first is based on.Anyways, where to start with this picture? The structure here is fantastic, contrasting‚Ä¶  
4460  I forgot that I was watching a film, and all these people are not real but fictional, and that it was not filmed in the 40s but the 70s; such is the impeccability with which Mario Puzo and Sir Francis Ford Coppola created this world.The Godfather II is a masterclass in screenwriting, brilliance in blocking, lighting, and framing, masterfulness in direction, and near perfection in acting by Al Pacino and Robert De Niro.But more than that it is‚Ä¶

4471  Beautiful, fantastic, perfect but someway, somehow I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs better than the first. The Godfather: Part II is a perfect movie that is a definite, the way the story is put on screen and the way it is crafted is nothing short of amazing. Like it‚Äôs predecessor the performances are some of the all time greats, with Robert DeNiro successfully capturing the magic that Marlon Brando gave us in the first and Al Pacino who is the main star‚Ä¶  
4472 I genuinely can‚Äôt decide if I like this or the first one more.¬†Not sure why I put this off for so long. 
4473 While, yes, many agree that this is superior to The Godfather¬†I gotta admit that this one always lacked something for me. It's a brilliant film nonetheless, no doubt about it and I've been watching it with great love in my heart ever since I was about 12 and yet it isn't flawlessly perfect to me.¬†What I always loved in this one were the visuals, how they tell the story of their own and almost predict the future. But my favourite thing is John Cazale, period.

4475 #453HDToday.tvAn absolute masterpiece.Think I preferred it to the first one. Watching Michael struggle with his two families and all the threats that come to him, Al Pacino was fantastic here.And then, watching the rise of Vito Corleone was astonishing. From Italian immigrant to the saviour of his neighbourhood, he truly is one of the best characters in cinema. Not to forget how good Robert De Niro was as well.Can‚Äôt believe it has taken me this long to watch this epic work of art. 
4476 Some may say that this movie is better than the first Godfather, but in my humble opinion The Godfather: Part II comes VERY close to surpassing the greatness of the original, but ultimately doesn‚Äôt. Al Pacino is fantastic as the new Don and seeing a young Robert De Niro as Vito Corleone is the cherry on top. I just love seeing the fall of Michael and the rise of Vito at the same time. This is such an extraordinary tale of betrayal and power and is definitely a must watch masterpiece. 
4477 i‚Äôd definitely let young vito corleone fucking hit 
4478  There's always been a debate about whether G2 is a better film than G1, but my vote still goes to the original. Certainly the sequel is beautifully (and more expensively) made, but to me it lacks a sense of drama, feeling more like a lavish soap opera than a movie. Thematically it's a great counterpoint to The Godfather, but it takes an awfully long time for that theme to become clear, it being muddied by the historical flashbacks and a‚Ä¶  
4479 Easily the one of the greatest sequels ever made. I cant decide which one I like more, either way they're both masterpieces.Edit: I lowered my rating because of rewatchability and how dense it is. I usually don't let that effect ratings but this one really stood out. 
4480  If part one was the rise, this is most certainly the fall. While there exists a personal preference to part one, one cannot deny the mastery of part two, subverting expectations and uncovering Michael Corleone to show us who he truly is. This truly is his movie and shows the progression all the way from when he was just the baby of a young De Niro (which by the way is an extremely odd sight after seeing him as an‚Ä¶

4483 I watched it and loved it . And had to make the comment ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt make movies like this anymore‚Äù 
4484 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   So I rewatched The Godfather Part II for the 2nd time and its amazing.I understand that some people have a diversive opinion about the 2nd installment of The Godfather Trilogy. Some people prefer the first one which is a classic and some people loved this one because it's quite dark and tragic.For me this is easily the best Godfather movie I've ever seen and one of my top 3 personal fav sequel (along with 2049 and The Dark‚Ä¶   
4485 Incredible to see this on the big screen, but I honestly think having an actual intermission kind of dampened the momentum the film had built up to that point. Still a toss-up for me as to which is better, this or its predecessor, but good lord are they both absolutely overwhelming achievements. My god. 
4486 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  no way home level theatrical cheers but it's me alone in my room yelling when vito says that he'll make fanucci an offer he can't refuse.is it even a spoiler at this point? i dunno. i guess since it's taken me this long to watch it there is bound to be someone else out there who hasn't yet. stayin on the safe side.can't say what has already been said many many times, and so it is my pleasure to confirm all of the great things. my goodness, what a film.  
4487  Watching The Godfather 1 and 2 back to back in 4K Ultra HD made me realize that I do prefer one over the other. The one being The Godfather 1.It mostly hinges on the overall consistency 1 has that 2 doesn't. Out of the two films, 2 has undoubtedly the highest highs but also the lowest lows with some faults that stick out when you have to be so nitpicky comparing the two films. 1 is so consistent in‚Ä¶

Fertig ist eines der besten Sequels der Filmgeschichte, welches dem Original in nichts nachsteht. 
4490 I know this is considered FFC's undeniable magnus opus but I honestly can only watch this as an extension of it's predecessor, so ultimately, I do prefer the first movie. Regardless of my opinion, there's no denying this movie is exquisite and undoubtedly essential to the advancement of film. 
4491 Again not much to say other than what another special experience watching this classic on the big screen. I still prefer Part 1 but that doesn‚Äôt take anything away from how amazing this one is. 
4492 the ending is what makes this for me. i‚Äôd probably give it five stars anyways but it‚Äôs that last scene that really tops it all off and breaks my heart into pieces. utter perfection, i love my short psychotic husband michael corleone so much <3 
4493 Filmmaking at its absolute finest. The sheer scale of this movie rivals any epic in my humble opinion. Francis Ford Coppola‚Äôs direction is even better here than in the first movie and that‚Äôs saying something. The Godfather Part II (1974) just pips its predecessor to the post for me. The perfect movie? As near as dammit.1st Review 
4494 :) 
4495  Like Godfather 1. There is so much to unpack here that a Letterboxd review simply isn't suited for so I won't even try to write the 10,000 word essay this movie requires I will spend the rest of my life debating whether this is better than Godfather 1 or not. This is arguably more complex and nuanced. And when you know what happens to a certain character... it makes every scene leading up to it infinitely more tense. The way‚Ä¶

4497  What‚Äôs to be said that hasn‚Äôt already been said for decades? It‚Äôs a sprawling epic masterpiece that can‚Äôt be beat. All the Fredo stuff broke my heart, especially the scene where he confesses to Michael. Just sitting pathetically in that low chair shouting that he demands respect, that he‚Äôs not dumb like everyone says, that he‚Äôs smart. John Cazale is a one-of-a-kind actor, nobody else like that. There‚Äôs so much vulnerability in his performance.¬†Obviously Pacino and De Niro are‚Ä¶

4502 This movie hands down deserves greater than 5 stars. It‚Äôs a pure masterpiece from start to finish, and is personally my favorite movie of all time. Taking what I loved from the first Godfather and turning it up to 10. Michael‚Äôs character arc in this is PHENOMENAL and really sells this movie. Solid scenes all around, great score, and great movie. Highly recommend. 
4503  May of 2020, I rewatched Part one by myself. This was in preparation to rewatch part two with my then girlfriend, now fianc√©. It would have been her first time viewing it. It ended up not happening with rewatching part two in 2020, which was a shame. A year & a half later, we‚Äôre trying to pick a film & she blurts out that she finally wants to watch part two. I of course put the Blu-ray in right away. Truthfully, This‚Ä¶  
4504 Michael Corleone had impeccable style for a mob boss 
4505 I mean.... Its aight... Overrated in My opinion though. Just overall boring dialouge and just poorly executed acting. They all sound so tired all the time. Not enough action OR Comedy, didnt make me laugh once. I Guess in some aspects its Good, like for example i respect the amount of work put out by amateures and i Guess that they nailed the "Mafia Lifestyle" but its just a bit underwealming for me 
4506 am i crying cuz this was depressing as hell or cuz al didn‚Äôt win an oscar for it. or both 
4507  Always thought this was at least a couple of steps below The Godfather but the more I watch it the more I appreciate its rewarding character arcs, attempts to expand the narrative and thematic scope, going over multiple timelines and locations with finesse and I‚Äôve come a long way from thinking the parallel storylines between Vito‚Äôs rise//Michael‚Äôs struggling to keep the enterprise together+subsequent descent into madness was sloppily put together years and years ago.¬†This go-around I found its reflective,‚Ä¶

4510 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   4.5* to 5* on a rewatch.The Godfather Part 2 is the perfect sequel. To have two different stories in the same film and not be confusing or feel out of place is unbelievable.

4521 they all just seem like such good fellas. 
4522 I prefer part 1 over this 
4523 First one's flawless. This is great, just not flawless. 
4524 I feel like the fact that this is both a prequel and a sequel gets often overlooked. Could they probably have done two separate movies? Sure, but this works well anyway.Different than the first in that Don Vito feels more likable despite committing similar crimes. Michael‚Äôs doing them feels unnatural and cold, which I suppose is the point of the movie: it‚Äôs all unnatural and not what he wanted for himself. 
4525 My father taught me many things here - he taught me in this room. He taught me: keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.¬†gonna need 3-5 business days to process the masterpiece i just watched. 
4526 I definitely didn‚Äôt expect to like it this much more on my fourth watch.While most of the praise for the Godfather films is towards the first film this one deserves just as much praise. This three and a half hour masterpiece is just as good as the first film and in some areas even better. Michaels character arc is done insanely well, perfectly paced and I think the stuff with Robert DeNiro is my favourite stuff in the whole trilogy.One of the few perfect films. 
4527 hope the new year brings everyone more luck than it did for fredo corleone 
4528 The Godfather is better than The Godfather: Part II.¬†Fight me.üòõ 
4529 How does Coppola do it?... Beyond magisterial. 
4530 i cant get enough of this guy 
4531 The contrast between Vito and Michael is even more stark in this. One based their decisions out of love and one did not. Michael didn‚Äôt follow his father‚Äôs advice to Sonny in the first movie and pays the price for it: ‚Äúa man who doesn‚Äôt spend time with his family can never be a real man.‚Äù 
4532 finalmente consegui ver inteiro, de uma vez s√≥¬†eu acho que gostei mais desse do que do primeiro (????) achei que seria imposs√≠vel, mas eu adorei como eles expandiram o universo e desenvolveram o michael e o vito. e adorei todo o contexto hist√≥rico interferindo na narrativa, algo que n√£o era muito forte no primeiro¬†(ainda acho o primeiro mais ic√¥nico, por outro lado)e puta merda eu ODEIO o fredo homem insuport√°vel¬†agora o vito‚Ä¶ ü•∞üòçüòò 
4533  How to lose trust in everyone in 3 hoursFor a very long time I always used to always say that this was my favourite from the three, but on a rewatch it's most definitely a solid second place. That's not saying it's now bad or gotten any worse, it's just a testament to how perfect the first film is. Part II is more of the fantastic, epic genius from the first, but with a little too much extra meat‚Ä¶  
4534 I do not think that this film is superior to the first or vice-versa, primarily because to me it will forever be a united 6 hour film (havent seen the 3rd yet). All in all, The Godfathers are great because while I would not rave about it like I would with Rebecca or Sunset Boulevard, it is easy to see the utter perfection that the film has in itself and god bless the 70s for being so liberal with the artists‚Äô creative control, why did it have to change :( 
4535 everyone always talks about how The Godfather movies are the greatest ever made but if they would‚Äôve led with how hot al pacino and robert de niro were, i would‚Äôve watched them much sooner 
4536  Yes. Another masterpiece that really deserves all the praise it gets. I think this one is a better made film and is basically flawless, but I think Part I I enjoy more. With that out of the way, this is one hell of an epic sequel. The story adds so much after part one, and the performances have increased so much. Al Pacino gives one of the best performances of all time, and I honestly couldn‚Äôt find a single flaw.‚Ä¶  
4537  I'm not sure what it was but I wasn't nearly as invested in this as I was the first. It's still pretty damn good tho.It's definitely a mix of both the pacing being noticeably worse than the first and also the fact that Marlon Brando's Vito Corleone isn't in this really makes the movie feel empty. I absolutely loved the beginning segment with a young Vito Corleone coming to America but afterward, I felt like I was watching passively.‚Ä¶  
4538 In some ways, this is a better one than the first - better narrative, darker cinematography, connected to world events more than the first - but I still consider both equals in their own way.Really hope the Coda redeems the third one and gives this story the closure it properly deserves. God help you, Francis - I have faith in you to pull it off.If anyone's wondering, there's a marathon on; really. 
4539  one of the most beautifully tragic things i‚Äôve ever watched. ¬†there‚Äôs so much you could talk about when it comes to the emotional depth this movie has, but it would just be wasting time at this point. read the reviews i‚Äôve liked as they explain it much more eloquently.¬†instead i‚Äôm just gonna mention one of my favorite subtle moments this movie does perfectly out of a 10000000 moments. ¬†that is when michael returns to his family estate after kay‚Ä¶  
4540 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   A true cinematic masterpiece. To say this movie is a just great cinema or a great sequel doesn't do it justice as it doesn't the first film. These movies are life lessons in the way they display principals and code. A way of life.The simultaneous timelines showing the rise of Vito Corleone and and fall of Michael Corleone is just amazing. A young Vito getting his revenge and that final scene with Michael just sitting there sticks with you.‚Ä¶   
4541  "If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it is that you can kill anyone."I genuinely can't fathom how anyone can claim that this is a better film than the original The Godfather. Part II is a very fine film, and just as thoughtful and meticulous as its predecessor, but it is hardly as powerful or riveting on its own. The flashback sequences are amazing, but only because we know that they lead into‚Ä¶

4549  Al Pacino, a loveable dick: The MovieI definitely prefer the first one to this. I mean this has some great scenes, like New Years Eve, Vito‚Äôs revenge, Kay‚Äôs and Michael‚Äôs fight... Kay‚Äôs and Michael‚Äôs fight!!!¬†Those are absolutely awesome. But as a whole package it has its problems.I don‚Äôt personally care about Vito‚Äôs story that much. And basically that‚Äôs the film‚Äôs undoing in my opinion. It feels much more artificial and easy than the present storyline. There‚Äôs too much‚Ä¶  
4550 Somehow this had even better pacing than the first? 
4551  I have always seen the first two The Godfather films as equals and almost impossible to pick a favourite. Until this viewing. Both films are absolutely brilliant, but there is a sense of complete and utterly mastery in the first Godfather that is more and less impossible to follow up on. Thinking back on the two films they blended together into a single film and on this rewatch I realized that almost all of my favourite parts were from the‚Ä¶  
4552 This one hits differently than the first, but not necessarily in a negative way. While I believe The Godfather- Part 1 is the better film, this is one of the best sequels of all time. (Spoilers ahead)Part 1 is a culmination of ferocity and family. They have each other‚Äôs backs through it all. Part 2 sees Michael take a turn. He begins to turn against those he loves most... losing a part of who he was. The final scene encapsulates so much. The loss of what was¬†to what now is.¬†Brilliant cinematography, score, and acting all around. 
4553 MORE THAN A CRIME FILM (YET AGAIN!)Amazing. Michael Corleone has the best character development in cinematic history; I will fight anyone on this.I don‚Äôt know why I deprived myself of The Godfather and its sequel my entire life. Shameful...P.S. if anyone wants to work in film and loves movies yet has lost motivation, honestly (re)watch this and the first one. Both are perfection and really uplifted my mood!!The Italians did what needed to be done. Period! 
4554 Really good mind you, but it is in no way better than the first. This is mainly due two semi disconnected stories that due little other than merely co-exist with each other, we get no time developing Vito's family in the beginning and Hymen Roth is incredibly uninteresting. It doesn't take away from any of its great qualities though as everything from the acting, sets, writing and cinematography is stellar. Worth a watch for sure. Just failed to live up to the original just like Michael failed to fully live up to Vito. 
4555 : I know it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart. You broke my heart!The scene where the immigrants üáÆüáπ are coming in on the ship and the Statue Of Liberty üóΩ. Possibly the greatest in film history¬†What a fucking great movie 6 stars out of five 
4556 It's so good I didn't even care about these 202 minutes.Though I think it would make more sense if Vito's arc would be in the first movie and not here(but that's just my opinion). 
4557  Godfather Part I and II are masterpieces, classics of not just their genre but film entirely. That said, I personally prefer Part II.I don't view them as the rise and fall of Michael Corleone as the Godfather, but rather a story concerned with Michael's loss of heart and the death of his identity. He is god, but not father. He is a ruthless businessman with no personal life, joy, or family. He is sharp, alive, electric in matters of‚Ä¶  
4558  ‚ÄúYou broke my heart.‚ÄùWhile I still prefer the first film, there‚Äôs no denying the mastery of this film and how close it gets to the greatness of part I. This film is so devastating and at least three parts made me tear up this time around. The stuff with young Vito is fascinating and I was satisfied while also wanting more and Michael‚Äôs arc is expanded on from the first and he transitions from a bad man to diabolical‚Ä¶  
4559  On this rewatch, my only flaws with this one are that Fredo‚Äôs betrayal should‚Äôve been a bit more clear in the early stages of that plot, and that this film reminds me a bit to much of certain scenes from the first one, but I understand that it isn‚Äôt as much repeating those scenes as they are showing the contrast between how Vito Ran things in the first one, and how Micheal handles them in this one, so it isn‚Äôt‚Ä¶  
4560  Until recently, I had lived under a heavy, wet blanket of shame --- for decades --- simply because I had never seen Francis Ford Coppola‚Äôs first two ‚ÄúGodfather‚Äù films. ‚ÄúThe Godfather‚Äù (1972) and ‚ÄúThe Godfather Part II‚Äù (1974) are landmarks in American film. No argument. Case closed. ‚ÄúBest of‚Äù movie lists litter the Internet, but one of the more credible ones, the American Film Institute‚Äôs latest ‚Äú100 Greatest American Films of All Time‚Äù list, has the first ‚ÄúGodfather‚Äù ranked at‚Ä¶  
4561 Although I do prefer the first one, this film is still very much a masterpiece and I would argue that it's much harder to get right due to the two timelines running in parallel (I've always found the young Vito story far more compelling than the modern day stuff) and yet Coppola still manages to make this film one of the best ever. 
4562 Ouvi dizer que esse filme √© t√£o aclamado quanto o primeiro, e eu concordo que ele esteja no n√≠vel. √â engra√ßado que ele talvez funcione perfeitamente se tiver isolado, digo, de um lado a hist√≥ria do Don Vito colocando sua fam√≠lia sempre em prioridade em seus neg√≥cio e do outro a ascens√£o de seu filho Michael herdando o legado de seu pai e que, diferente do pai, n√£o √© capaz de manter um equil√≠brio entre a vida pessoal a profissional. Nem preciso mencionar a parte t√©cnica, s√≥ destaque para a fotografia fant√°stica. Filme lindo, merecidamente marcado para a hist√≥ria.ps: a cena final üîùüîùüîùüîùüîùüîùüîù 
4563 Loneliness instead of family by way of Antonioni. If the first movie is a masterpiece of pace and structure, the second is a masterpiece of mood and theme. Absolutely devastating. 
4564  In strictly objective terms, I can completely understand why everyone seems to rate this film as one of the greatest if not the greatest film of all time. In this regard, I cannot deny that The Godfather and Part II are impeccably crafted and make it impossible to take your eyes away despite their very long runtimes. The two most standout aspects of the film are its composition and the performances. Each scene is blocked as meticulously as any stage‚Ä¶  
4565 Turns out family isn‚Äôt forever. This is thematically more interesting and has more depth than the first, but I still prefer the first one simply because I like the characters and central dynamic there more. I wish it would have focused more on the on the change in Michael and young Vito (really enjoyed the flashbacks) rather than spending so much time on the Cuba storyline, which while still enjoyable, is easily the weakest part of the film. Thankfully, it picks itself back up and goes off on a high note with the ending. Really leaves you with something to think about. 
4566 That was a whole lot to digest. I'm definitely going to need to see this again before I make a fully-formulated comment of any kind. Currently skewing positive (obviously) but I can't put my finger on any specifics except that I think I like the first one better. 
4567  I now know that I am more of a ‚ÄûGodfather part one-guy‚Äú.I really liked this movie!It did a lot right: The score is once again brilliant. Even better than in the first one. The great melancholic main theme is sometimes even worked into each scene, played by individual instruments, perfectly fitting to the situation.I really liked the two stories as well! Michaels story was masterfully continued and Vito Corleones younger self and what he did and whitnessed‚Ä¶  
4568 Ok, well, I definitely liked the first one more. This is still amazing though.Part II has a pretty pessimistic tone. The Godfather Trilogy is really just the story of the downfall of the Corleone family. Kind of a bummer.My "Holy Shit This Is Amazing Acting Award" goes to that scene between Michael and Kay. WOWZAAt this moment I feel no love for you at all. I never thought that could happen, but it has. 
4569  Just as amazing as the original. I don't think I liked this one more than The Godfather, instead I feel like it's just a continuation of the same film. Like how I view The Lord of the Rings as one huge epic. I think that's what Copolla was going for, too.Well, I've finally lost my Godfather virginity. It feels so good to finally get this movie off my watchlist- I put it on there the first day I joined‚Ä¶  
4570  Obviously this film deserves all the praise it gets, but I do have a problem with the pacing/editing of the story. I would like to have seen the entire Vitto story at the beginning of the film rather than interrupting the Michael story. I have never seen the chronological edit of the first two films together, but I do think that the extended edit may appeal to me, mostly because to my knowledge the Vitto origin story appears first. Now‚Ä¶  
4571 I'm convinced 99% of the people who left a 5 star review on Godfather movies would all fail a lie detector test. Tony Sopranos therapy sessions were more entertaining than this entire franchise. My family would kill me if they ever saw this rating. Just know I keep it funky motherfucker, better get it right 
4572  Und ich bin wieder fassungslos. Ich wusste noch, dass "The Godfather Part II" sehr stark war, aber wie stark, wusste ich nicht. Ich kann ohne Zweifel sagen, dass dies die beste Fortsetzung aller Zeiten ist. Es kann sogar sein, dass dieses Meisterwerk besser ist, als der erste Teil. Wie Coppola die Geschichte rund um die Corleone Familie weitererz√§hlt, ist unmenschlich. Michael's langsamer Verfall des Wahnsinns ist so beeindruckend, faszinierend und dramatisch mitanzusehen. Al Pacino h√§tte es nicht besser spielen k√∂nnen‚Ä¶  
4573 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   ‚ÄúKeep your friends close, but your enemies closer.‚ÄùThe Godfather didn‚Äôt need a sequel, and before seeing it I never would have expected it to be on par with the first one.¬†I could argue that this one is even better than the first, but how can it be better than an already perfect film?

4576  I‚Äôm not in the camp of thinking Part 2 is better than the first; the first film is the most innovative movie of all time, with its complex narrative of family relations and Italian immigrants coming to America at the turn of the century, its world of criminals and violence, and its many universal, relatable themes.¬†Part 2 doesn‚Äôt have the same flow or immense build up, but it is an epic film as a continuation of that initial story.‚Ä¶  
4577 getting this outta the way before I get drafted 
4578 Kay I love you I will treat you like Michael never could 
4579 Next time you're in a Godfather mood, I recommend watching Part II first, where Michael is left with his own broken conscience at the end, gets lost in thought and remembers how "Pop" ran things- an idealized version of the 'golden age' of the Corleones. When they still had the muscle. When all accounts were settled for the family business. 
4580 Sin palabras.No s√© qu√© decir para describir lo que acabo de ver.Gracias por hacerme pasar 3 horas y 22 minutos sin despegarme de la pantalla ni un s√≥lo segundo. La interpretaci√≥n de Al Pacino es de lo mejor que he visto hasta ahora en una pel√≠cula, se come las escenas s√≥lo con la mirada.Dicen que las segundas partes nunca fueron buenas, pero a veces son mejores. 
4581 O bagulho √© da pesada. 
4582 Al Pacino ate an orange the same way I used to eat them as a joke in the school cafeteria: biting through the peel. 
4583 Saw The Godfather for the first time a decade ago in high school and have seen it 3 times since. I really don‚Äôt know what took me so long to watch part2...but I now know what I was missing.¬†This is incredible. Better than the first. Love the expansion of the ItalianAmerican lives and culture.An obvious masterpiece like everyone says. 
4584  this was outstanding on every level. al pacinos performance is absolutely haunting, how did he not win best actor?? i loved loved LOVED the ending, don‚Äôt even wanna watch part three cause i loved how this ended so much. needless to say the new years party scene was the best moment in the film for me¬†also, a lottttt of people say this is better than the first. to me, they‚Äôre equally as good. however, i enjoyed the godfather way‚Ä¶  
4585 this is a vito corleone stan account till further notice 
4586 I saw the first movie probably over 10 times and i consider it an absolute classic, but i only saw the sequel once a long time ago and i forgot most of it so i felt it was time for a rewatch. I love how it blends so well with the first one it really does feel like an organic whole, but it also feels different enough and not just the same movie again. 
4587 ‚Äú...this Sicilian thing, that‚Äôs been going on for 2000 year-‚Äúü§≠‚ÄúYOU WON‚ÄôT TAKE MY CHILDREN!‚ÄùüòÆ68 people on Letterboxd gave The Godfather Part II¬†a half a star. You people are dicks and probably voted for Harambe in 2016. 
4588 AFI Top 100 Club: boxd.it/1cOzaFilm #3- The Godfather Part III could talk for hours about how amazing this film is, but I just wanna say that the last 60 seconds before the intermission, is the greatest moment in film history. #noregretsA+ 
4589 *snoozes thru about 1 1/2 hrs of this*the only parts i cared about were robert deniro's srry(only given 3 stars bc i'm related to francis ford coppola, i owe him) 
4590 Until the intermission I was a little nonplussed, I think I missed Brando. The Landlord scene cheered me up though and Michael's failures and successes, along with his fathers, are a truly fascinating watch. What a character, what a performance. I‚Äôm going to man-up and brave Part 3. What a hero... 
4591 robert de niro as vito corleone, thats the review. 
4592 The Godfather: Part II walked so that Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again could fly üôèüèª 
4593 Perfect. Absolutely perfect.¬†¬†Robert De Niro 1974‚Äôs sexiest man alive?? 
4594 so many huge insane beautiful crowd scenes‚Ä¶ incredible family study‚Ä¶. but most of all, Al Pacino wears a bunch of really chic silk scarves in this movie and I think this will inspire the shopping I‚Äôm planning on doing tomorrow 
4595 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   This masterpiece builds on the first. Michael removes him self further and further away from the hinir honorable and true man he once was. The final flashback scene highlights this gracefully.¬†I also love that Kay got released from her love spell. She realized who her husband has become when she lost all love for him. Of course she knew all along, but she ignored it, for him. Her character went full circle. She got out but Michael went all‚Ä¶   
4596 I mean, this is just a masterpiece. Always kind of said the first movie and second were even for me but after the rewatch the second one just blows it out of the water. Unreal performance from Pacino. The story line with the background of Don Vito is just unreal as well. Genuinely think that this could easily be the best movie ever made. Godfather Part II, welcome to the top 4. 
4597 the ffc watch/rewatchathon begins‚Ä¶ hoping it will speak a MEGALOPOLIS release date into existence. also just happy to rewatch masterpieces over the next few weeks, no reason to complain about that ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
4598 for the longest time i put off watching this movie. like years and years and years. the first one is just so astoundingly good, and conventional wisdom says that this one is even better, but for some reason i was still worries that i would be let down and it wouldn‚Äôt live up to the hype.uh anyway yeah this was really really incredible don‚Äôt know why i waited so long lol. 
4599 A better movie than the original. This is pretty much cinematic perfection. I had no pacing issues here. This had me from the first frame to the last.¬†One thing. Why do the mafia always send old blokes to whack someone? it‚Äôs always some 70 year old with a hip replacement. 
4600 Just slightly better than Mamma Mia 2 
4601 feeling like the biggest film bro for consuming both movies today.¬†I don't feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom. Just my enemies.the way some random guy in my row literally quoted that as it happened‚Ä¶ 
4602 confirmed it does indeed get better with each viewing, dense with insights on love/forgiveness and the corruption of man. al pacino‚Äôs performance and michael‚Äôs ruminations at the end struck me this watch‚Äînot sympathy but the beauty of recognizing his admirable traits that are used tragically for evil and confused as love for his family. cliche, but it did actually strengthen my love for true love in seeing its absence. as always i love tom hagen, himself broken in less noticeable ways too. can relate. can tragedy be beautiful in its skilled depiction? yes per chance 
4603  The continuing adventures of cinema‚Äôs favourite crime family. At minimum, this is probably the perfect sequel. It adds to the story, reconnects the audience with its characters and their lives all while expanding the universe in an impressive way. Throughout the film and the business involving Michael, flashbacks of Vito Corleone‚Äôs early life and career defining moments. This was my favourite part, I think it‚Äôs a clever commentary on the American story. Vito escaping a dangerous situation in Sicily, immigrating‚Ä¶

4610  For years, I'd resisted the idea that The Godfather: Part II is equal to the first, or at least disagreed with the notion. I've always liked it a lot, but I remember seeing these films for the first time when I was about 15 (almost half a lifetime ago now!) and loving Part I while liking Part II (as for Part III? I've only seen it once, and there are elements I like. But I really do feel like the‚Ä¶

But I think for me personally, The Godfather is for sure a perfect film. It‚Äôs arguably the best film‚Ä¶

4616 I prefer the first, but this was still pretty great 
4617  All the richness of family & the Italian culture is stripped away for a heart shattering character study of Michael Corleone.The first ceremony in the movie shows how Italian culture has been abandoned for a more American way of doing things and that exists throughout the entire movie.Michael leaves his Italian roots behind to adopt a more commercial way of doing this or in his words turn the Corleone family into a legitimate business and there is the word "Business" I‚Ä¶  
4618 Doesn't quite reach the dramatic peaks of the first and isn't paced as well but the further elaboration on the characters and ideas is still effective and moving. Can see it growing on me a bit more on a rewatch but I think I click with the first more on a formal and dramatic level while understanding why some people might prefer this one. 
4619 this felt like 10 years long but it was a good 10 years. That‚Äôs all 
4620 The easiest 3 and a half hour watch in cinema history. It moves and flows with such an effortless grace, seamlessly transitioning between different characters, different countries, and different generations. There isn't a wasted moment, there isn't a bad scene. The last half hour is just transcendent, especially that beautiful little flashback coda.The best films feel like old friends, and Godfather Part II is one of my oldest and dearest. Fun fact: in maybe 20-30 viewings of this film over the years, I never clocked a young Harry Dean Stanton as one of the FBI agents before. How is that even possible? 
4621  Can‚Äôt believe this whole movie is about a guy ****ing his own brother.You know, I used to be really disappointed that Marlon didn‚Äôt return for the very end. I used to think that was the only thing keeping this from being a perfect movie. And as much as it would‚Äôve made my heart grow to see Vitto walk through that door, hearing the grandchildren yell and seeing the entire family‚Äîexcept Michael‚Äîrush out to see him‚Ä¶the fact that that towering‚Ä¶  
4622  "It was a son, Michael! A son! And I had it killed because this all must end!"I enjoyed this a lot more than its predecessor. The problems with pacing and tediousness (this movie absolutely did not need to be 3 and a half hours long) were still there, but unlike the first one there's a new depth and complexity to everything that keeps you more engaged. The story is more interesting, the visuals more meaningful, and the characters more‚Ä¶  
4623  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying, darling.‚ÄùThere‚Äôs a strong argument to be made about this being the greatest film of all time, and while that‚Äôs been discussed to death at this point, something I feel doesn‚Äôt get discussed enough with this film is how relentlessly miserable it is. This is one of the loneliest and most depressing films I‚Äôve ever come across. Michael smiles for only one singular moment throughout the film‚Äôs perfectly paced 200 minute runtime. His expression is so cold, desolate‚Ä¶  
4624  ‚Äúkeep your friends close but your enemies even closer‚ÄúThis is the best 3 hour + movie I have ever seen, even though I do think it‚Äôs not as good as it‚Äôs predecessor it‚Äôs still an absolute masterpiece.

4625 This is one of the best movies I‚Äôve ever seen. 
4626 It is as good as they say. The character development, especially for Michael and Tom, is the best in the entire sequel. The cinematography reaches its peak in this movie, and the ending is beautifully done, both sad and intense. It did feel slow at times, but it's a 10.

4629  And after Part I, comes the end to the greatest film to ever be made, The Godfather: Part II. Usually combined with the first, and though of as one film, The Godfather: Part II does something that hasn't, and likely won't be done again, that being the perfect sequel.You might think to yourself how one could create something so perfect, that goes along with something so extraordinarily, but I have the answer, and it's Francis Ford Coppola.

4636 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   This may be a somewhat hot take, but I don't think The Godfather: Part II is superior to the first film. There's much to love it about it, particularly everything to do with Robert De Niro's young Vito, but the pacing almost kills it for me. Aside than a few exceptions (i.e Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings Trilogy), I groan at the sight of any film that goes for over three hours. However, this is the only reason why‚Ä¶

The first two films changed the way that movies could look, with their use of shadow and sharp contrast.However, it‚Äôs interesting how the two films manage to look similar and distinct.

4648  Darker and sadder than the first Godfather, Part II depicts both the moral devolution of Michael Corleone and, in flashbacks, the rise of his father, Vito Corleone. Francis Ford Coppola masterfully blends the two stories together into one film. As Roger Ebert points out in his essay in The Great Movies III, Vito Corleone, despite being a ruthless mafia boss, is a sympathetic character in The Godfather and in Part II. In comparison, Michael, while sympathetic in the first film,‚Ä¶  
4649  It‚Äôs fitting in many ways to revisit this on the night of the final episode of Better Call Saul. The American anti-hero, whether we call him Tony Soprano, Don Draper, Walter White, or even Saul ‚ÄúSlippin‚Äô Jimmy‚Äù Goodman, is almost always made in the image of the original: Michael Corleone.¬†Whatever it takes to get them ahead in life, no matter how unjustly the cards were stacked against them, there‚Äôs an equal price that‚Äôs paid at home. As Vito sagely‚Ä¶  
4650  Keep your friends close, but your enemies closerNever thought Coppola could ever top GF 1, but he really did.¬†This film is simply flawless.

This film is really‚Ä¶  
4651  ‚ÄúKeep your friends close, but your enemies closer.‚ÄùI had originally intended to watch this film almost straight after seeing Part I, but, considering the fact that it‚Äôs 3 hours and 20 minutes long, I just didn‚Äôt have the time. Also, similar to how I felt before watching the first film, I found the long runtime very off-putting.Although I did have a few issues with the pacing, on the whole I‚Äôd say that this film was worth the watch.‚Ä¶

4653  Really enjoyed part 1 but I found this pretty redundant.What killed me were the flashbacks. To me at least, the choice to mix Vito's youth with Michael's present time was a mistake, felt so disjointed. Not to mention the choppy italian that populated these scenes. We already saw a whole movie of Michael becoming Don, why do we need to thematically go back again and tell the story of Kid Vito? I get that the movie tries to show‚Ä¶

I rewatched the original yesterday while nursing a wicked hangover, so I decided to finally catch up on the sequel today. And I gotta say, it‚Äôs a pretty great movie.¬†The Godfather Part II¬†improves on some of the small imperfections of the original. It feels like‚Ä¶  
4657 Well I didn‚Äôt think it could be done, but this was somehow better than the first which was extremely rare.

If you haven‚Äôt seen this I highly recommend, this will definitely end up in my top 30.

4665 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Empires rise and empires fall. Whereas the rise of the Corleone family may be simple; a killing here, a killing there, the slow demise is complex, with Michael grasping at fragile webs of power, slung between deceit and betrayal. His feeble attempts to legitimise the family, drive them apart, as he shows that not even family is safe from business. The Godfather: Part II is a chess match, and whilst Michael may end up playing the winning moves for a checkmate, it costs him pawns, knights and ultimately his queen.

4678 La verdad no s√© que decir, me gust√≥ mucho la pel√≠cula pero si me pareci√≥ que es un poco larga.Me encant√≥ ver la forma en la que nos van contando la historia de Vito y Michael al mismo tiempo, nos muestran una dualidad muy interesante.Me pareci√≥ curiosa la historia de Vito Corleone y de como pas√≥ a ser un inmigrante al ser uno de los capos m√°s importantes de la Mafia estadounidense. 
4679  Vieles entwickelt sich hier sehr parallel zu seinem Vorg√§nger nur mit neu verteilten Positionen. Michael ist der neue Pate, ein Verr√§ter wird gesucht und Rache praktiziert. Etwas ver√§ppelt kann man sich schon vorkommen, wenn dazu die Vergangenheit von Vito (k)eine gro√üe Rolle spielt. Die Backstory eines verstorbenen Charakters wird √ºber gro√üe Teile des Films erz√§hlt und ein Payoff scheint mir nicht ersichtlich. M√∂glich scheint mir, dass ein Zyklus sozialer Vererbung gezeigt werden soll: Die Geschichte von Vito beginnt mit Blut,‚Ä¶  
4680  Heavy is the head that wears the crown.If Part I serves as an exposition for Michael's origin story as the next Godfather, then Part II is the dreadful unraveling of the consequences to the circumstances into which Michael was born.I've elected to rewatch parts I and II in preparation to rid the very bottom of my watchlist of Part III, though I've heard it's subpar.

4683 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   This is the best sequel of all time. I personally prefer The Godfather to The Godfather Part II, but you are picking from two top 25 all time movies. It's crazy to think Sofia Coppola's dad made 3 of the of the best movies of all time.I won't dive too deep on a movie that has years of material out to read, listen to, and watch. I will say I enjoy how Coppola explores Micheal's transformation into an "American"‚Ä¶   
4684 Watching all Best Picture Winners in random order.¬†I seriously cannot decide if I like Part 1 or Part 2 better. They are both masterpieces and are some of the greatest movies ever made. Nothing more really needs to be said at this point about these movies.boxd.it/aR13M 
4685  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom. Just my enemies.‚ÄùLike I already mentioned in my review of¬†The Godfather, I don‚Äôt agree with the popular opinion that Part II¬†is better than the original.The screenplay is a hot mess. It‚Äôs both a prequel and a sequel at the same time, and is essentially two films stuffed in one. I understand that the point here is to juxtapose the fall of the Corleone¬†family under Michael‚Äôs¬†destructive reign with Vito¬†building‚Ä¶  
4686 The only thirst watch that makes me look cultured 
4687 Maybe someday I can see the recut of the first two films that puts everything in order. Until then I'll continue loving the Michael stuff here and getting slightly annoyed when it cuts back to Vito's rise, which might make a fine film on its own but disrupts the more intriguing present day. 
4688 a cursed lineage. even the act of american authority assigning the name ‚Äúcorleone‚Äù to vito, over his birth name, carries major weight in that regard. corleone is the town where vito was born. it‚Äôs where his whole family was killed. it‚Äôs where the hex was placed; on the lawn of don cici‚Äôs mansion. cici himself declares the inevitability of vito‚Äôs existence, exactly as it occurs years later. it‚Äôs a part of him forever. doomed.cinema operating at its highest power. 
4689  Road to CodaToppling perfection isn‚Äôt an easy task. Sequels, though mostly not the case, are always expected to top the original. So when the idea of surpassing a film like ‚ÄòThe Godfather‚Äô¬†arises, it‚Äôs practically impossible. But it‚Äôs been done. Francis Ford Coppola not only made the most flawless sequel known to man, but the absolute greatest piece of film ever put to the silver screen. 202 minutes and I never lost my involvement into the film. It‚Äôs truly an‚Ä¶  
4690 Not as cinematographically gripping as the first, but still wonderfully written and brilliantly performed. DeNiro makes a welcome appearance as young Vito - a character made iconic by Brando - but Al Pacino steals the show with all his captivating nuance. The story unfolds in deceptive directions, with betrayal at every turn and secrecy in every step, leading to dead ends for some characters and the edge of a cliff for others, trapped by their own desires and hunger for power, only to be killed like a piece on a chess board - with the Godfather pulling all the strings.

Michael giving Fredo that kiss ‚ÄúI knew it was you‚Äù just as the rebels are storming Havana. It‚Äôs like how long can you steal from people before you face the consequences?

4695  "Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer"The perfect sequel and follow-up to the legendary The Godfather. A story circling around family, business, and legacy. Immaculately directed, beautifully shot, and edited to feel comfortably paced (despite it's 3+ hour runtime). The runtime is necessary and valid. There, I said it. The beautiful score aids the emotional beats throughout, creating polar atmospheres highlighting the visceral ups and downs of the story.Al Pacino turns in a powerful, moving performance, stepping‚Ä¶

4697 Re-watched with the first one. Astonishing as always but this time around I‚Äôm able to say definitively that, for me, the first one is the Best Film Ever rather than this one. 
4698 recently learned that whenever an orange appears on screen it‚Äôs to foreshadow a death or near death situation involving the corleone family and i really love that hidden aspect of the films. 
4699 It's a little bit too long but man The Godfather is a gorgeous & ambitious piece of filmmaking. I enjoyed Part I's pacing a little more but this is still a really great film overall. Beautiful cinematography, performances and direction make this a real winner. 
4700 A pesar de que me gust√≥ m√°s ligeramente la primera, esta es igual de buena, todo lo positivo de la primera entrega se encuentra presente en esta segunda. La historia de Don Vito desde ni√±o hasta que consigue ser quien era antes de morir es lo que m√°s me gust√≥, y tambi√©n que vemos completamente como Michael se pasa al lado malvado. 
4701 COVID-19. Self-quarantine movie watch #254.This is probably the most chaotic one out of the three and it still is an amazing sequel. Something that is rare to say. Still, it is still not my taste.Al Pacino is awesome here. 
4702  My hottest Godfather take is that it's supposed to be pronounced "Jodfather"My favorite character is Vito's assistant because he has a HUGE fuckin hatI always go back and forth on which Godfather I like more, because the first one is so clean and constant, but the sequel is a straight-up Biblical EPIC. The whole thing is structured as this whole Old Testament/New Testament thing, and the scene where Michael tells Fredo that someone has betrayed him and there‚Ä¶  
4703 While most of the times sequels are just cheap reasons to generate more money for a studio, I think this is one of the greatest sequels ever made, both technically and historically.Every shot, every frame... it feels like everything in this movie was carefully planned and executed, resulting in an exquisite cinematic experience. The score naturally flows and helps giving life to the movie. From the origins of The Godfather himself, to the empire his son had to take care of, this film is a trip back in time and a poem to cinema. 
4704 honestly wish there was something higher than 5 stars cos i rated the first one 5/5 but i think somehow this one manages to be even better¬†al pacino is so pretty in this and for what 
4705 i know i rave about how perfect al pacino‚Äôs performance in this is, but I will not discourage robert de niro‚Äôs A M A Z I N G performance. flawless movie with some of the most memorable scenes in cinema 
4706 Don‚Äôt broke your brother‚Äôs heart, Fredo 
4707 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   The perfect sequel. I had high expectations for this movie and Francis Ford Coppola went OFF I mean I love how the scenes go from Michael Corleone‚Äôs time to Vito Corleone‚Äôs time. I thought I was gonna be confused but it was such a great addition to the movie.I‚Äôm gonna gush for a while because Robert De Niro did so GOOD I mean when he spoke the entire movie in a Sicilian dialect... mr worldwide üòçüòçüòçI read somewhere‚Ä¶   
4708 i know michael is a bad bitch bc he ate an orange as if it were an apple 
4709  I will need much time, rest, and possibly tranquilizers to recover from these two films. Thank God I now have had the pleasure to consume them. How Coppola was able to create and master this material as he did is simply legendary: majestic. Proof that Italians do it better? I'd be remiss not to concur.Staggering beauty and daunting composition in each shot, all weaved into two intertwining narratives: past and present. De Niro an Pacino really whack these roles‚Ä¶  
4710 Perfection as always. 
4711 The best sequel ever made? 
4712 No doubt about it, The Godfather Part II is marginally better than Part I in my humble opinion. Because of the extra 20 minutes, the film has extra time to flesh out the characters even more, which definitely shows. Everybody was stronger in this film than in the first. This might actually be the best¬†Best Picture. But because I liked it so much, I don‚Äôt really want to watch Part III because I think I‚Äôm gonna be sorely disappointed. 
4713 An excellent sequel that is very nearly-equal to the original, and mandatory viewing immediately after watching the first. 
4714 Really showcases how amazing Coppola is both as a director and a writer. 
4715 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   The rise of the Godfather, and the fall of his son. Two different stories interwoven with different tones for contrasting effect. If I had to pick one, I enjoyed Vito's story more for it's simplicity and memorable scenes. It starts off pulling no punches with Vito's mother sacrificing herself for him, creating Vito's beliefs of family over everything. Then the immigration scenes which I thought were beautifully shot, had me reflecting about my own grandpa's journey from Italy. The beginning‚Ä¶   
4716 Just gets better. They should put it in a museum alongside the Ark of the Covenant. Nino Rota's score kills over and over. Vito and Michael waving from the train in Sicily accompanied by the faded theme, quieter, stringing out, coming apart. The tragedy of our times. They'll study it in 300 years. 
4717 it must be said: the sequel outdid the first film 
4718 I have seen The Godfather: Part II twice this year in theaters, and three times overall. It truly never gets old for me, and each time I watch it I find more things to appreciate.Al Pacino should have won an Oscar, and I will say this until the day I die. 
4719 I feel like a nutcase not giving this a 5, but I think I need another watch to get it there. This is obviously a masterclass in filmmaking, every department cranked up to a 10/10. There‚Äôs just a ton in the film that is hard to get a hold of with just one watch, so while I just can‚Äôt get it to the 5 yet I‚Äôm sure it will next time I see it. I‚Äôd say I prefer the first film more right now but again that‚Äôs subject to change, either way this is still a masterpiece. 
4720 The best sealed moral world ever captured on film where the only crime is disloyalty. 
4721  ‚ÄúKeep your friends close and your enemies closer‚ÄùIn terms of Dramas, cinematically, this is it, this is the peak of what cinema has to offer as far as I‚Äôm concerned. This movie is definitely the best written, directed, and acted drama I‚Äôve ever seen.

4722 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   (Viewed a restored 35mm print.)These movies are pickled in a queasy brine-- hubris, blood, acrimony, nostalgia.To me this wasn't two separate stories at all, but rather a single narrative about a son coming to terms with his role as his father's successor, contemplating a younger version of his father who he admires and wants to emulate, while his own life proves more toxic and complex, until he ultimately realizes that the version he imagined doesn't reflect reality, and‚Ä¶

4728  Big step up from the first, though this has no right to be as long as it is.I'll never forget an otherwise insufferable high school classmate of mine adroitly observing the massive gulf between his privileged, American teen fuck up existence, and the lives of his grandparents who were survivors of the Armenian genocide. That's basically what this movie is about. The American dream isn't so much an identifiable process as it is the byproduct of the impoverished and‚Ä¶

4736  I guess that was a little over due. Coppola's epic is probably an example of a film that contains the upper limit of flaws, but I would still call it a masterpiece. It's an incredibly smooth film, paced like it knew from the get-go that it would go on to be one of the best films in the history of the medium, Coppola never distances himself too far from what goes on on screen, the performances are obviously incredible and‚Ä¶

They are different beasts. Personally I prefer quieter‚Ä¶  
4738 A near-perfect continuation of the first movie. I really missed Marlon Brando but the flashbacks with Robert De Niro made up for it. Deciding on if I should watch Part III or just leave it. 
4739 larger in scope and ambition, Godfather II manages to improve on fantastic and make the classic first film look like a soap opera. here Coppola is let loose and he has made his masterpiece and definitive statement on the Coreleone saga. I can only imagine what the studio thought as he said he was going to intercut a prequel story featuring a then barely known Deniro as young Vito. It's a miracle the film works as well it does and still does. 
4740  The dialogue? Superb.The score? Mesmerising.The cinematography? To die for.There is pretty much all praise from here on in. I'm finding it hard to come up with a flaw for this cinematic landmark and I'm coming to the conclusion that there isn't one. Miles better than the first one (and I mean that in a good way) exploring the lives of both Michael's and Vito's story lines, I found myself invested through the whole 200 minute run time.‚Ä¶

In the editing, storytelling or just how certain shots are framed.

4768 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   I love the narrative and storytelling devices present in this prequel/sequel. It‚Äôs almost more of a tragedy than the first film, as Michael has fallen now to the vices he so vehemently rejected at Connie‚Äôs wedding‚Ä¶Two highlighted scenes I‚Äôd like to mention are Fredo and Michael‚Äôs final full conversation in the room overlooking the lake.

4769 May be an unpopular opinion but I think that this is better than the first one 
4770  So no one ever bothered to tell me that Robert De Niro used to look like this??? All this time I thought he just looked like the guy from Meet the Fockers but no, he looked like THAT? Wow. Unbelievable. Those cheekbones. Those legs, my God. You know when he did the classic De Niro face where his mouth goes like :-( ?? I had to pause it because it was honestly too much.

4775 this is just as good as part 1 but its just personal preference 
4776 This was way more personal and emotional than the first one.¬†And I actually like the first part more?

4780 Some guy got up and started yelling at the woman next to him that she had a low IQ or something? I love the film forum! Very cool. 
4781 I think the first one is the better film of the two, but I might enjoy this one a little more.¬†John Cazale is the MVP here. 
4782 the fucking scene with the fredo in the dysfunctional chair and michael is all like "you're nothing to me now. you're not a brother" üò© 
4783 For whatever reason, I tend to favor the second movie in most trilogies, and without question, that trend now applies to The Godfather Part II (I'm sure Part III is great, but I can't see it topping this).Like all the best sequels, The Godfather Part II fleshes out the history of everything that worked in the original, doubles down on character relationships and development, and takes the story into a much deeper, darker, and in many ways more personal direction. It gives me even more appreciation for its already fantastic predecessor and is easily one of the best sequels (and prequels) ever made! 
4784 Outdoes¬†Part I¬†ever so easily¬†in my opinion.Al Pacino is such a presence here; maybe my new favorite performance of all time.So glad I capped off the year with this one. Such a masterpiece. Happy new year, everyone! 
4785 I know it's sacrilegious, but I wasn't too crazy about Part 2 of The Godfather. It's basically Part 1, but with no Marlon Brando. 
4786 hubba hubbaStill hugely prefer the first, if only for the fascinating transformation of Michael Corleone (he remains one of the great characters, even though his temperament and disposition remains in stasis for the 200 minutes), but wowza woozacan't get over the pit-in-stomach hopelessness these movies provoke, they're so fucking visceral it hurtsthat is allwow, what a newsflash, someone calling THE GODFATHER PART II a masterpiece

4794  Yeah I'm not gonna lie this is basically as good as everyone says it is. Such a HUGE improvement over the first film which I wasn't too huge a fan of.

4801 It‚Äôs not better then the first one in my humble opinion ¬†and the Robert De Niro bits are much better then the other story line but it‚Äôs still a classic and one of THE best sequels ever made. 
4802 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Godfather Part II is another example of a sequel that surpasses its original. It‚Äôs a unique film that serves as a sequel and prequel to the Godfather, showing more of what Michael is up to after securing his position as the don and giving us an interesting glimpse to Vito and his rise to power. It‚Äôs two interesting stories on two incredibly interesting stories. On Michael‚Äôs side, CAN WE FIRST TALK ABOUT HOW OUTSTANDING AL PACINO IS! He was obviously‚Ä¶   
4803  I've done a complete 180 on this film. If you had asked me just yesterday what I thought of The Godfather Part II, I would've gone into a tirade about the film being terrible and an abject failure of a sequel. Something's changed though seeing as this time I was really compelled in seeing Michael's reign as Don play out and I enjoyed my viewing of this film more so than I did with Part I. I've always been a‚Ä¶  
4804  Just as entertaining as the first. The Godfather: Part II is one of the most classic pieces of cinema that explores the journey of the Corleone family. It delves deep into the moral complexities of its characters which are heavily uplifted by riveting acting performances. However, I was less emotionally engaged compared to the original; nonetheless, there were some pretty dramatic scenes that I simply weren‚Äôt attached to. At times, I was wishing more screen time of Robert De Niro,‚Ä¶  
4805  A criticism I've seen of this is that Michael's arc is a retread, going over the same plot beats as last time. This I absolutely don't agree with. If the story in the first Godfather was about fate and Michael rising up the ranks to replace his father, this one is the destruction of Michael's soul and cutting most (if not all) of his emotional bonds. He never learned to balance light and dark, family man and ruthless killer, like‚Ä¶  
4806  Jesus Christ I don‚Äôt know if anything will be as perfect as Godfather parts 1 and 2. It‚Äôs hard for me to choose which one is better. I think part 2 is the better made film and Coppola really finds his groove in this one. You can tell he‚Äôs more confident and he knows exactly how everything should be. Going back and forth from Michael‚Äôs present story to Vito‚Äôs rise to power is flawless. So many good moments and character‚Ä¶

I can handle the truth.   feeling conflicted, a bit underwhelmed, and unsure. i‚Äôll admit i didn‚Äôt really follow all of the plot (in the present day storyline, i understand the whole robert de niro part bc i read it in the book) but overall i think i got the gist of it. i think michael is not a likeable character in this and he seems to have lost his entire moral compass. he‚Äôs losing the integrity that his father had, and the people around him‚Ä¶   
4808  How did I ever think this movie was overrated. it is truly a masterpeice and Micheal Corleone is one of the greatest characters in movie history, the acting is second to none, the cinematograhpy and themes are amazing, once again as I said in my previous reveiw Robert DeNiro does an outstanding job as playing Vito Corloene even though he doesnt come close to Marlon Brando he still did amazing.

4809 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   It‚Äôs crazy to me that Part 1 is the one that‚Äôs usually considered one of, if not the best movie ever, when it‚Äôs not even the best one in it‚Äôs own series. Part 2 is just so clean to me. It feels like such a natural progression of how the story is shown. There is no more ‚Äòfamily‚Äô, it‚Äôs just business. It‚Äôs similar to¬†Sergio Leone‚Äôs Once Upon a Time in the West. It shows that transition. I get why someone‚Ä¶   
4810 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  A filmmaking masterpiece in every aspect. Upon rewatching I noticed amazing details, like when Michael asks Fredo if he knows Hymon Roth and he is physically nervous. The soundtrack is an extraordinary classic that doesn‚Äôt get boring.  
4811  Very rarely does a sequel prove to be better than its predecessor, and The Godfather Part 2 is probably the finest example of that case in cinematic history. It serves as a character study of both Vito and Michael Corleone by narrating stories of two different timelines and indicating the differences in the regime of both of them and the problems they each faced, and the beauty is it also discussed the intimate side of things with these two men‚Ä¶  
4812 This second film gave me IT. Great performances from the cast, rich and brilliant storytelling, character development, Vito Corleone's backstory, and highly intriguing family drama. I love how this sequel brought a lot more depth and development to the table, it surely did not disappoint.

4826  Comparado con la primera vez que la vi me ha gustado mucho mas, pero no termino de alucinar con la que son para muchos dos de las mejores peliculas de la historia. Quiz√°s es que simplemente no soy muy fan de las peliculas de mafiosos, quitando las de scorsese (sobre todo infiltrados) que me parecen pel√≠culas espectaculares en muchos sentidos, y alguna gran obra por ah√≠ suelta como erase una vez en america, no termino de fascinarme con casi ninguna.‚Ä¶  
4827 All my life I heard this is like the prime example of a sequel better than the first. Are you kidding me? Still a good movie but honestly. Between this and my opinion on Terminator (way superior to sequel) I just feel like I should go live in a cave and watch movies by myself forever. Which I basically do already but can they all have Al Pacino in them? 
4828  I think I‚Äôve taken the opportunity a fair few times to make a stink on this site about how much I‚Äôve hated getting older (I‚Äôm feeling the cold embrace of death at 22 years old), but watching this tonight I felt that same ennui, which surprised me, given that this is a gangster epic. The increased responsibilities and greater expectations Michael experiences I suddenly understood on a greater level. We see an older generation that seemed to have it much‚Ä¶

Brilliant supporting performance and another great 4K upscale, it looks fantastic.1st Review2nd Review 
4847 Took me a rewatch to realize how great this movie is. My favorite stories are the one‚Äôs that aren‚Äôt afraid to take their time to develop and godfather 2 is like 11 hours long. 
4848 The Godfather Part 2 is a masterclass in characterization. For example, you know Michael Corleone is beyond redemption when in Act 3 he eats an orange like an apple with skin intact 
4849 It's wild how different the mood is for this film's "climax" in comparison to the baptism montage of the first film. One of the most hopeless and despairing voids in the history of American cinema. 
4850 The contrast between a son's haggard attempt at exacting old revenges with his father's rise to power. Both fueled by vengeance, the father uniting his family against a common enemy. The son in a paranoid spiral of revenge, removing the familial protection his father established. The father began alone, the son ends alone. Vito feels like a hero and Michael like a villain. It's not just a corruption of power, but the degradation of the soul that comes with revenge. 
4851  72THE GODFATHER: PART II is simply not as great as the first part, but it's still extraordinarily well made. The prequel/sequel swapping worked significantly better than I was fearing, though I am not sure whether the movie would be better served if it just focused on one of them and maybe cut down on its runtime. Though it had its severe lengths, especially halfway through with the Cuban sequences (at least to me) it still had many great standalone‚Ä¶

4868  The Godfather Part II is an incredible achievement but it‚Äôs never felt quite as iconic to me as Part I. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs a deeper, more emotionally resonant film that trades in most of its mafia action for a slower, more introspective drama about business dealings, expansion and the perils of being at the head of a family when everyone wants to see you fall. It‚Äôs a fantastic movie that I loved even more seeing for the first‚Ä¶

4885  remarkable. this grossly overused adjective is nowhere near enough to unerringly describe how this sequel-slash-prequel delivered a film of such unmistakable prestige. part I was definitely more satisfyingly violent, but this part seemed to have deliberately took its time to portray a moral bankruptcy of a character with a ridiculously gorgeous but deceptively innocent facade. it was a saga that i personally felt more attached with than its predecessor. months after watching the latter, i could only vaguely recall snippets‚Ä¶

4889 this movie changed the trajectory of my life 
4890 michael corleone vencendo a xenofobia mais uma vez que del√≠cia. nao esperava nada do que aconteceu no filme e as 3 horas passaram tao rapido que nem notei, o de niro novinho falando em italiano no filme que lindeza, por mim o filme seria todinho em italiano, por que que lingua linda viu, muito triste tamb√©m ver a ruina do michael mas pelo menos o vito tava indo mega bem.em rela√ß√£o a partes t√©cnicas n√£o tenho palavras, tudo muito bem montado, nao √© pra pouco que ganhou de melhor filme igual o primeiro 
4891 Non mi piacciono gli estremismi, ma questo √® probabilmente il sequel pi√π intelligente della storia del cinema. Coppola prende il mito del primo film, lo ricostruisce e lo distrugge, mostrando le analogie tra l'ascesa al potere di Vito Corleone e la caduta del figlio Michael. Le storie si incontrano, si intrecciano e si sovrappongono perfettamente, mettendo sul piatto pi√π che un semplice film sulle origini, ma un vero e proprio ritratto politico di due epoche. 
4892 I‚Äôm not sure why it took me so long to watch this masterpiece but I‚Äôm glad I finally did. Al Pacino‚Äôs performance in this has to be one of the best subtle acting I‚Äôve ever seen. 
4893 i think this director could do with a few tips from the classics, perhaps he should try watching shrek 2 or paddington 2. rather disappointing, but i didn‚Äôt expect a lot from this indie budget film with an unknown cast. 
4894 One of the great sequels of the 20th Century as it explores a paralleling narrative of a man's rise from a lonely immigrant child to a mob boss putting family first and his son's fall to paranoia, mistrust, and corruption. 
4895  ‚ÄúI know it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart.

4912 My boyfriend: Vito Corleone respects and protects his family above all. To him the patrilineal is sacred. Whereas Michael Corleone progressively and callously erodes the family line and ends up a shadow of his father; his own son destroyed, the dynasty ended. Me: Robert De Niro is hotter than Al Pacino. 
4913  Coppola's second instalment in his 3 part epic is by far the most special. Much less a sequel and more of an evolution of the first, Coppola uses what he constructed within his first flick- constant anticipation, shocking murders- and builds on it, using it at each possible moment to keep the audience in fear of who these power hungry sharks are going to kill next. Coppola's strength within this film is his ability to capture a room, creating through‚Ä¶

I suspect that my rating, and indeed my review of what‚Äôs considered one of the greatest movies of all time, The Godfather, will get me some shit until it gets buried after I write a series of other reviews. For the moment I must deal with it, but in addition I can now say that The Godfather Part‚Ä¶  
4916 I know it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart. 
4917 The best Pacino performance I think. This, Dog Day Afternoon, and Heat are sort of his holy trinity in my estimation, they highlight the best of everything he does well. And I think this is my favorite of those three. Where Heat is him at his biggest without going over the top, and Dog Day Afternoon is thoroughly neurotic and full of nervous energy, this is a tightly clenched performance that makes his outbursts absolutely terrifying.Good movie, this one. Do recommend, two thumbs way up 
4918 Tender black eyes of the father transmuted into the dead black eyes of his son 
4919 I can‚Äôt decide which film is better; this or the first one. A lot of what I felt watching the first movie I also felt watching this one, that feeling mostly being anxiety. But I‚Äôd have to say I like this film better overall because it gives the audience a better perspective over the history of the Corleone family, and elevates the tension not only between the other crime bosses, but also the tension amongst the Corleone family themselves. 
4920 The Works | The Godfather trilogyCoppola‚Äôs ambitious prequel/sequel of De Niro‚Äôs Vito‚Äòs rise in the 1910s juxtaposed with Pacino‚Äôs Michael‚Äòs decline in the 1950s is a masterful follow-up on cinema‚Äôs infamous crime family; a meticulously crafted, methodical piece that expands on the first film in every conceivable way.The Godfather trilogy ranked 
4921 wow, this was long. doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs bad though! i‚Äôm pretty sure i like this one just a tad more than part one. even though michael corleone is a dick, i love al pacino‚Äôs acting, he‚Äôs so good! i‚Äôm glad that this one feels engaging (compared to the first) and i made it through without passing out, hurray to me! because of the length i probably won‚Äôt watch these again for a LONG time (if ever) but at least i‚Äôve seen them! 
4922  For some reason I really didn‚Äôt get into this much. It was ok but nowhere near the first oneI thought the stuff with De Niro, though he was giving a great performance, it felt very disconnected and out of the rest of the picture, I liked it a lot more when it was the Pacino stuff but even then it had some flaws and it didn‚Äôt completely deliver for me. Maybe it has something to do with Brando, even‚Ä¶  
4923 This movie has everything... Al Pacino and Robert de Niro being sexy and speaking sicilian... Family drama... Yearning and nostalgia... Constant twists and turns... Harry Dean Stanton... 5 stars!!! 
4924 was expecting to be more excited about this one, but if I has to pick which is better, I‚Äôd say without a doubt the first movie. this was great, I really loved how it utilized flashbacks, and just having De Niro takes the cake for me. but I don‚Äôt know, the film even felt longer than the first film which I had no trouble watching. (yes I know it actually is longer, I‚Äôm just saying it FEELS longer.) anyway, I‚Äôve read a lot of comments that the third part is the underappreciated one, so let‚Äôs see how that goes. 
4925  Yeah this film is a masterpiece in almost every way. Not many sequels are just as good if not better than it predecessor but part 2 is very satisfying expansion the the godfather and some believe its better than the first. I still believe the godfather is slightly better but I‚Äôve seen both of the films 3 times each and they have so much rewatch ability for 3 hours films I‚Äôll probably rewatch both very soon.¬†As I‚Äôve sayed it‚Äôs‚Ä¶  
4926 Perfect cast. Perfect directing. Perfect script. Perfect movie. Perfect sequel. 
4927  While I'm still in favor of the original, The Godfather: Part II is powerful in how a man with the duality of good and evil can pursue in a lifespan.¬†Might need another viewing to reaffirm everything, but as far as the ending is concerned, the final shot of Michael Corleone left me in awe.¬†All those flashbacks (especially the dinner scene) were such a strong presence in the film. It's basically the summation of his life in one close-up tracking‚Ä¶  
4928 is it a masterpiece? of coursebut am I going to ignore how the plot is over complicated and is paced inconsistently? no.¬†I don‚Äôt need to say Pacino is fantastic, you already know that.

Cierto es que iguala a la anterior (que ya era dificil√≠simo), y adem√°s funciona tambi√©n como precuela.Cre√≠ que echar√≠a de menos a Marlon Brado en √©sta, pero la verdad es que con Robert De Niro como Vito, queda m√°s que suplido. Me encanta c√≥mo enfrenta las dos tramas; que muestran los inicios de un criminal casi considerado h√©roe,‚Ä¶  
4941  If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it is that you can kill anyone.Michael's descend into complete lack of humanity is still amazingly shocking and frightening and the genius of Coppola's transitions between present and past, specially the one after Michael hears the gunshot that by his word murdered his brother into a simpler and "happier" time for the Corleone family before Connie and Carlos' marriage, is to this day unmatched.The precise‚Ä¶

4943  "They don't make 'em like they used to."I'm sure the phrase applied to much older films, and I'm sure they were even saying it in the 70s about the 30s-50s the same way I heard it in the 90s and 2000s about the 70s. It's true, of course, but the extent to which you view that as a problem...well that's a subject for another day.Part of it is economic - who's going to pay for a three-hour-plus movie‚Ä¶  
4944 great sequel, the main issue i have with this movie is that it‚Äôs just too long for my attention span honestly especially in the first half of this movie it definitely picks up after the first hour and i enjoyed it a whole lot more after that. slow paced movie but still great. 
4945 Never not thinking about how Al Pacino never got an Oscar for playing Michael Corleone. 
4946 I have finally seen it. Following its predecessor, which is an absolute behemoth, Part II is a richer, more personal tale that Coppola weaves so immaculately.

4948  Finally saw the highly acclaimed second part to what a lot of folks call the best movie ever made.While I really liked The Godfather and admired it for it's filmmaking quality, I just really liked the story and the characters. I was in the family, whether I liked it or not. I felt the same way here again. This crime family's story is just so riveting, and the way it's all helmed makes it so engaging and thrilling. It‚Ä¶  
4949  Curioso como √© um filme que parece muito mais apaixonado por suas imagens do que o primeiro. L√°, o filme, fora alguns momentos, n√£o consegue ir muito al√©m dessa encena√ß√£o da fam√≠lia envolvida no crime, suas conex√µes e seus rostos, n√£o tendo tanto interesse nem na representa√ß√£o de √©poca (muito mais acess√≥ria de plot do que qualquer coisa), nem no pr√≥prio g√™nero g√¢ngster (devido, principalmente, ao roteiro que a nenhum momento privilegia a trama em si).

4950  After so many years, I finally decided to watch The Godfather II. Before I go any further, I'll start off by saying, no, I don't think it tops The Godfather, but don't let that deter you from watching Francis Ford Coppola's near masterpiece.¬†The crime saga picks up the story of Michael Corleone (Pacino) as he expands his empire to Cuba and deals with troubles with the local mafia. Interspliced with Michael's story, we are shown the rise of Vito‚Ä¶  
4951 MICHAEL CORLEONE.... YOUNG AL PACINO.... PLEASE CALL ME I‚ÄôLL GIVE YOU A FOOT MASSAGE FOR FREE.... I‚ÄôVE PLANTED THE SEED AND I WILL SEE THE HARVEST 
4952 What an amazing film. Easily one of the best sequels ever made. Al Pacino is amazing as Michael. Robert De Niro is amazing. The entire cast is amazing. Coppola directs a film so epic and powerful and iconic and memorable and so many other adjectives. The script, written by Coppola and Mario Puzo, is literally perfect. The score is astounding. Everything about this movie is glorious. It, along with its predecessor, have become two of my favorite films of all time.The Holy Grail (my favorite films)

AFI Top 100 Club: boxd.it/1cOzaFilm #3: The Godfather: Part II by Francis Ford CoppolaWhat could possibly follow up The Godfather, one of the most famous and popular films in all of cinema?¬†The Godfather: Part II was not just a sequel. This was a sequel that was even more brilliant than its predecessor.¬†Built perfectly upon the events and happenings of the original, it was exquisitely told, all whilst it added more life to most of the characters‚Ä¶   
4954  Definitely a film I need to re-watch when I'm not as tired, as it could easily earn the prestigious rating of 5 stars from me, but for now, I'll give it a very high 4 1/2. It's easy to just give the second highest rated film of all time a 5 star, but I want to be as honest with the rating as possible.It's undeniable that this film isn't, at the very least, incredible. Both the first and this‚Ä¶  
4955  A perfect continuation of Mario Puzo's characters which expertly splices the young Vito Corleone journey from the novel and shows this rise to power in tandem with his son's downward spiral into damnation. The plot is superbly handled, the dual themes resonate harmoniously and the performances are truly exceptional.This is a sequel that expands on the lore of the first movie and pushes forward with a measured momentum that is equally satisfying and tragic.

It has everything a movie needs. Drama, Characters, Dialogue, Acting, Direction - Everything together creates one of, if not the greatest movie ever. Al Pacino as‚Ä¶  
4957  The greatest sequel of all-time. They key to The Godfather Part II's success is that it makes no effort to merely repeat the formula of the original film. It's still a crime story with a similar visual style, it opens on a celebration juxtaposed with mob business, and it features a montage of murder in the third act, but these elements come naturally and aid a story which takes its own approach. Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo dive deeper‚Ä¶  
4958  Paramount. Coppola Restoration Blu-Ray1.85:1Color35mm18"My father taught me many things here - he taught me in this room. He taught me: keep your friends close, but your enemies closer"The idea to blend a prequel and sequel into one film was brilliant idea from Coppola. It could've only have worked with the success of its predecessor but none the less it gives the audience so much this time around. We get far more than we bargained‚Ä¶  
4959  Maybe Godfather Part 2 was hyped up too much with its iconic status but I found this sequel far less enjoyable than the original. The acting and directing is still phenomenal but the story lacks. In the first movie Michael (Al Pacino) has an interesting story arc as a family outsider becomes a vengeful mob boss. In Part 2 Michael plateaus has he goes from bad guy to even more bad guy. The most interesting aspect was the telling of‚Ä¶  
4960  There was this kid I grew up with; he was younger than me. Sorta looked up to me, you know. We did our first work together, worked our way out of the street. Things were good, we made the most of it. During Prohibition, we ran molasses into Canada... made a fortune, your father, too. As much as anyone, I loved him and trusted him. Later on he had an idea to build a city out of a desert stop-over‚Ä¶  
4961 The Corleone saga continues with a prequel and a sequel in the story. Al pacino was excellent in this movie as Robert di nero Stucks with you for his amazing performance as Vito Corleone. It was sad as Al pacino didn't won an Academy Award for his performance. Another Legendary movie in the Godfather. 
4962 save me young al pacino, save me 
4963  I truly wish I liked these more than I do. As before with the Godfather rewatch, I find myself enjoying this plenty. Recognizing it's greatness, appreciating it's beauty, and at times being drawn into the quiet chaos of the Corleone's. But, I'm just not on the same page as the rest of the world it seems. To be clear, this isn't a cool, contrarian film bro hot take. It's just that I never quite dial into the film's wavelengths. All‚Ä¶  
4964 Oscar Trinick smoked crack before watching this 
4965 Third watch. Possibly the best made film ever. 
4966 There is just nothing in this movie that interests me. Basically the first one but longer and more boring. 
4967  While I'm not one to get worked up about film critics' opinions & lists, I can choose to ignore said opinions & lists - and the recent Sight & Sound Top 100 List's exclusion of this masterpiece is laughable and pretty much renders the validity of the rest of the list questionable (at best).Coppola's epic (masterfully shot by Gordon Willis) spans several generations, over several decades, with a mammoth cast. It jumps between young Vito's forced immigration to America, his rise to‚Ä¶  
4968 The Godfather Part II (1974) I‚Äôve always thought of this one as better than the original, but after this reviewing of both, I think it‚Äôs a dead heat.

4971  Yeah, I think after three (or four?) times watching this one, I honestly believe that this is far superior than The Godfather Part II now and after rewatching this, it‚Äôs only made me realize how much I love this film from the acting, the direction, the two side-by-side stories with Vito‚Äôs rise to power and Michael‚Äôs fall from power, the writing, the dialogue, how natural this movie feels, and with how it adds more to the first part as a‚Ä¶  
4972 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Press F for Fredo. Don't care bout what everybody says, he will be missed  
4973  One year ago today I watched this movie for the first time and came across a review that would ruin my life. It said something along the lines of "is there anything sexier than 70s Robert de niro ripping apart a piece of bread?". Me and Ellie both didnt know the part that review was referencing. I was very curious. So I did some insane research. I watched every Robert de niro scene. I fast forwarded through the hole movie.‚Ä¶  
4974 Also, such an incredible piece of cinema that lives up to its icon status. I did feel myself getting more restless this one but it's mostly because I watch Part I right before this and watching that much movie in one day is hard work. I do wish there was more Robert De Niro as well but dang once again do the parallels between father and son work so incredibly well. Impeccable characters arcs. 
4975 michael whoreleone SUCKING on that orange i am devastated!!!!! 
4976  Gobsmacked that people enjoy this one more than the first. The first has such a satisfying arc! You meet the family! You see Michael fighting against what we all know is gonna happen as his father falls, his brother falls, and then he takes his rightful place with the climax of the baptism scene! Yeah!! (Also somewhere in the middle he‚Äôs in Sicily and gets married and then his wife who shows her boobs before she says her first lines‚Ä¶  
4977 when i die i would like to be greeted by robert de niro 
4978 mfs be like empire strikes back is the best movie sequel¬† ¬†lol 
4979 Now I'm worried to watch Part III because this was so good that I don't think the next one will top it 
4980 What an absolute honour to watch. Coppola‚Äôs finest. 
4981 honestly?? i‚Äôve just spent precisely 202 minutes being so invested in the story that i haven‚Äôt gone to the bathroom and now i might die but then i can say that the godfather killed me and being killed by 70‚Äôs al pacino is not in any way a bad thing 
4982 Think I can finally say this is better than Part 1 
4983 IN MY HOME! IN MY BEDROOM WHERE MY WIFE SLEEPS! WHERE MY CHILDREN PLAY WITH THEIR TOYS!The greatest film of all time?¬†Yeah probably.#25 
4984 Scavenger Hunt 53Definition of an Epic 
4985  When you think of someone as sociopathic or amoral, you tend to concentrate on the sense of emptiness that surely caused it, that surely perpetuates it, that surely consumes everything. The Godfather certainly considers that much about Michael, wonders what he actually feels for Apollonia or Kay or money or casinos or anything. But Part II concludes that there's always some semblance of reason, however base or irrelevant, and that reason more than occupies the space that we perceive as‚Ä¶  
4986 Just as I expected. Banger¬†But I think I liked the first one a lil more tho. 
4987 its 2 AM so this may not be coherent. anyways: wow, that was great. once again al pacino absolutely KILLED IT throughout the whole movie. robert de niro was really great too, all of his scenes were really great. i did sort of feel like i missed brando at times, but that really didnt take away from the movie at all for me. and lastly DIANE KEATON. her scene near the end was really incredible and blew me away! all in all: great amazing incredible. i just bought the whole godfather collection tonight so ill be watching part iii soon! 
4988 A deeper portrayal of power and organized crime within the legacy of Corleone. The acting and filmmaking continues to impress. However, DeNiro's Vito Corleone should've been explored much more instead of being sidelined for some occasionally uninteresting storytelling...That's what weighs this down, the blend between the Vito and Michael should've flown through better and paced better into the film instead of boring too much with every little thing Michael did. 
4989  The Godfather is my dad‚Äôs favorite movie. I watched for the first time in February 2018. It was my 500th logged movie. I don‚Äôt know why I wasn‚Äôt in a rush to watch Part II. I think there was a part of me that wanted to wait a little bit. So it‚Äôs been six years. Maybe I was waiting for another *occasion*. Have it be special. It was playing on 35mm at the Metrograph. It‚Äôs the 50th anniversary. Damn- I‚Äôm‚Ä¶  
4990 I JUST WATCHED THIS IN NEW YORK!!!!! ON 35MM FILM!!!! FOR THE FIRST TIME!!!!!!!! AND FOR FREE!! (you know it‚Äôs serious for me when i shed one single tear with the first frame)Every scene with Robert De Niro is so money. The score is simply breathtaking. 
4991  Wow, this was even better than the first one. I wish I was alive when this came out so I could've experienced the excitement of its release in theaters. I want to edit this and write a more thoughtful review after spring break starts and I get my brain functioning back. But for now, this was great and I'm glad I can say I finally finished the Godfather movies! (I'm not including 3 because I don't see myself watching that‚Ä¶  
4992 First time watch. My boss said if I didn‚Äôt watch it I‚Äôll be sleeping with the fishes so I watched it and it‚Äôs great. I heard part 3 isn‚Äôt very good. I‚Äôm gonna watch it anyway. Stay tuned.

4995 Always cool how this is the greatest movie ever made and it still isn‚Äôt as good as the first one. 
4996 I wish I could watch this for the first time again. There is nothing like the suspense this movie builds. 
4997  Rightly considered one of the greatest sequels (and prequels) of all time. The Godfather Part II feels even more like a sprawling epic than the first film did. The decision to focus on two different stories, the rise of a young Vito Corleone and the continued story of Michael Corleone, feels like it would be a mess yet it works perfectly.¬†Robert De Niro is fantastic as the younger Vito and Al Pacino is even more phenomenal as Michael as‚Ä¶  
4998  "The Godfather Part II" is a cinematic masterpiece. It serves as a perfect continuation of the first part, delivering another beautiful story and diverse characters in an astonishing way. The film blends crime and drama seamlessly, continuing to present great scenes for the story and significantly developing the characters. Both Al Pacino and Robert De Niro excel in portraying their roles, making this part an unforgettable cinematic experience. Their performances are among the best I have ever seen in cinema‚Ä¶

Taylor asked me when we watched part 1 if i would marry into the mob and my answer is still yes idgaf also another guest star appearance from HDS lmaooo 
5003 There‚Äôs a lot to appreciate in a film that‚Äôs influence I now recognize. Just about all of my favourite films have some debt to pay to The Godfather: Part ll. I just can‚Äôt for the life of me understand the need for the flashback scenes of Vito. Although the pacing was good, I feel like it would‚Äôve been the exact same movie without them.UPDATE: my friend mansplained it to me, the contrast is amazing.

5007  The Godfather Part II is a truly brilliant film. It has a similar plot to The Godfather (1972), but the subject matter of the story is portrayed differently, giving the story a fresh spin in the right direction. The second film is far more brutal and pessimistic than the first one. The Godfather Part 1 was a dark story, but it had happy glimmers of hope throughout the storyline, while Part II deals in hopelessness and the destruction of the‚Ä¶  
5008  Diciamocelo: Il Padrino: Parte II √® un film strutturalmente pi√π confuso del precedente, che tende a lavorare eccessivamente per accumulo, tentando di portare a casa troppi discorsi a causa delle ambizioni spropositate di Coppola. Il bello √® che sono proprio le ambizioni spropositate ad aver portato il suo autore nell‚Äôolimpo del cinema, e - di conseguenza - Il Padrino: Parte II rimane un capolavoro. Il dualismo tra Vito e Michael √® straordinario, perch√© racconta due facce della stessa medaglia, l‚Äôevoluzione‚Ä¶  
5009  I‚Äôll be honest, I couldn‚Äôt fall in love with this movie.Despite recognizing its excellent quality, from cinematography to the most refined interpretations, I felt every minute of its duration like a boulder on my shoulders. I found the existence of this film totally devoid of necessity, since the first part was so perfect even in its "open ending" not to justify a sequel. Although, as I have already said, the productive effort is as usual excellent, I found the‚Ä¶

5016 There‚Äôs long been a debate about whether or not this or the first one are the superior film, and I‚Äôm here to definitively settle it once and for all‚Ä¶ who cares? They‚Äôre both amazing!¬†In lieu of going on a multi paragraph diatribe about the filmmaking merits of this amazing film, I‚Äôll just say that it honestly didn‚Äôt feel like a nearly 3 1/2 hour film, and if that isn‚Äôt a compliment to how well it‚Äôs crafted, then I don‚Äôt know what else is. Also, having Robert DeNiro at the absolute top of his game didn‚Äôt hurt. 
5017 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  I didn‚Äôt expected that from fredo lmao  
5018 Kendall Roy coded!! 
5019 truly the longest most fucking confusing movie of all time 
5020 people are lying like crazy saying this is better than the first godfather because what????? this was a major drop in quality compared to the godfather and i didn‚Äôt really find it that enjoyable in the slightest. however, it is a very well made film and i did like the two parallel time settings with al pacino and robert de niro and their performances but that‚Äôs kind of where my enjoyment ends. 
5021 The flashbacks were decent at best and i felt they bogged down the pace of the actual events a lot but the ones in the second half gave some much needed perspective, Young Vito sure is a smokeshow Oh Boy .. 
5022  Between the series finales of Succession and Barry and now this, it‚Äôs been a downer media kind of week. Also, I know there are more important things to talk about regarding this movie, but I was so caught off guard by realizing how much Peaky Blinders drew from this! Tommy Shelby = Michael Corleone and I was just not expecting that.¬†Anyways, The Godfather: Part II is great, no doubt about it. I think I prefer Part I a bit‚Ä¶  
5023 Coming this summer, to CBS: Everybody hates Michael, the story of a dead eyed brooder who really needs to find a different way of solving his problems! 
5024  Let's get what I didn't like out the way.For one, the pacing is a nightmarish drag, the interesting exciting scenes are cut too short and the lengthy and slow conversations are cut too long. Emphasised with this is the fact the film attempts to tell 2 stories at once, Michael's struggles with the family and the business and Vitos rise as Don, prior to the events of the first film. I wholeheartedly believe that Vitos plot was absolutely unnecessary,‚Ä¶  
5025  Quite possibly the best American film ever. It manages to somehow be both huge and nuanced at the same time, the sign of a total master filmmaker at work. Indeed, Coppola himself only touched this kind of greatness once, though he came very close some years later ("Apocalypse. Now." [1979]). The actors are perfect in their roles, and cinematographer Gordon Willis works wonders with his camera, capturing both Sicily and Nevada with equal evocative power. Ultimately though, the whole is‚Ä¶

5028  100Seventh watch and this still incredible as always. Francis Ford Coppola didn‚Äôt miss on this film and the first one. Congrats to him for making one of the best trilogies and two best movies in the cinema history.Such an epic film this film is. I always have problems choosing who I prefer between the 1st and the 2nd one. I think I‚Äôll go again for the 2nd but both are masterpieces.Spoilers on this paragraph:I love how‚Ä¶

5030 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   "I don't feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom. Just my enemies."The Godfather: Part 2 truly is one of the greatest sequels ever made. It's crazy that Francis Ford Coppola managed to make a film that lived up to an already spectacular first film. But boy did he ever pull it off. I loved the fact that this movie is technically both a prequel and a sequel to the first movie. We get to see how Vito rose‚Ä¶   
5031 that masculine urge to make them an offer that they can‚Äôt refuse 
5032 Wow, y'all weren't kidding when you said the sequel was better! I liked the parallel dramas between Vito and Michael and I thought they balanced both storylines well. I also liked how Kay/Diane Keaton had more agency in this installment. Side note I really want cake now. There were like 3 scenes with cake in this movie. 
5033 female rage except it‚Äôs not female and it‚Äôs al pacino screaming at the top of his lungs in such a manner that the earth itself splits open 
5034 robert de niro!!!! zoo wee mama!!!!! 
5035 To argue which one of the two is better is almost pointless, because together they tell one of the most powerful stories in all of cinema. A rise and fall like no other and a character study that can‚Äôt be matched.¬†Proud to be an Italian tonight üáÆüáπ 
5036 Finally found the time to watch it and it's simply incredible. I still have Part 1 over this one, but this was still top tier. This is my first time watching The Godfather trilogy and I implore anyone who hasn't seen it (probably only a handful of people) to watch it once in their lifetime. Now it's time to be disappointed with Part 3. 
5037 I am dead inside. 
5038 O filme √© bom, mas um pouco mais enrolado que o primeiro. Os flashbacks, as vezes, fazia se perder na hist√≥ria e quebrando um pouco o cl√≠max do filme. Mas faz jus ao primeiro, sendo um boa continua√ß√£o. 
5039 And the Oscar for the hottest man goes to: James Caan!!! 
5040 yes this movie provides a fantastic telling of how loyalty to business over family and history will strip you of everything you have but i think more importantly we should acknowledge that michael corleone is the most girl loser icon of almost any movie ever 
5041 This movie is perfect. Usually I don‚Äôt like long movies but after 3hrs and 20 mins I wanted it to go for longer. Much better than the first one (even thought the first one is brilliant). I honestly can‚Äôt say anything that‚Äôs wrong with this movie 
5042  The best movie performance I've ever seen in my life yet. Al Pachino's expression, charisma, style, way of speaking, and the way he presents his emotions and expresses them on screen are something I have become obsessed with. De Niro was amazing in this film as well people say he is on the same level as al Pacino when it comes to acting well, I disagree but he still is amazing. Coming to the movie the rise and fall of‚Ä¶  
5043  ‚ÄúSenator, we're both part of the same hypocrisy.‚ÄùNo hay un plano en toda la pel√≠cula donde le veas los ojos a Michael y veas a un ser humano en paz con las decisiones y acciones que ha tomado, ver su mirada en los segundos finales de la cinta es una confirmaci√≥n de su angustia a lo largo de toda la pel√≠cula, es ver a un hombre que ha perdido su alma por seguir un camino que le prometi√≥ tenerlo‚Ä¶  
5044  THE GODFATHER PART 2 (1974)"The early life and career of Vito Corleone in 1920s New York City is portrayed, while his son, Michael, expands and tightens his grip on the family crime syndicate in the late 1950s.""I know it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart. You broke my heart!"_Michael Corleone (portrayed by Al Pacino).For me, The Godfather Part 2 feels like a necessary fitting follow-up to The Godfather (1972); like Halloween 2 (1981) can be watched‚Ä¶  
5045 my dad wants my friends to know this is his favorite part so much so that he made me watch bits of it throughout the day to ‚Äúreally appreciate it‚Äù so i would have to sit and contemplate every scene 
5046 I like the concept of a simultaneous sequel/prequel. This idea was utilized a lot during the recent final season of Better Call Saul. I was interested in diving even deeper into the lore and relationship dynamics of the Corleone family. Unfortunately I really felt the runtime on this one, a huge difference from my experience watching part 1. The film was shot well, acted well, and has its moments but overall I enjoyed this significantly less than the original. The plot just really failed to captivate me this time around and there are far less imaginative death scenes. Four stars out of five. 
5047 For all its accolades this doesn‚Äôt get enough credit as one of the most beautiful and diverse displays of male pattern baldness 
5048  The only thing that‚Äôs true are the blacks; not even fizzling out beside them the sepia tones for times that weren‚Äôt actually simpler, lying nostalgia for countries that weren‚Äôt actually less drenched in blood or gagged by the dust of revenge; certainly not when the sepia browns are burnished to golds. The void at the center is the truest black; the fringes of glimmering detritus just distractions in various shades of decay.‚ÄúHe was stupid; I was lucky.‚ÄùThere‚Äôs only‚Ä¶  
5049 It‚Äôs not often that a masterpiece is made just to be followed up by yet another masterpiece.¬†Once again, I don‚Äôt have to say anything. This film is already spoken for and to the highest regard but I do want to note on that last hour. Some of the most exceptional moments and filmmaking in general that I‚Äôve seen.Now just one more to go in the Trilogy.(24th Film watched on watchlist) 
5050 i just know al pacino got major back pain issues for carrying this trilogy alone on his back 
5051 So glad I finally got around to seeing this, I‚Äôd still probably say right now that I prefer the first but this was still so perfectly crafted with flashback scenes that never made me feel like I was taken out of the pacing. And that final shot was just the perfect way to wrap it all up. 
5052 It‚Äôs movies like this that make me grateful I‚Äôll be leading a life of poverty. Killing me would be absolutely pointless - spread the word 
5053 I love the first film and I think it‚Äôs a masterpiece but this is on another level and honestly better in every aspect and al Pacino probaly had the best acting preformance of all time‚Ä¶ Best movie of all time man

5058  I surprisingly liked it much more then the first one. Everything from the first one is upgraded by at least two, except the performances because those seemed to have just gotten more quieter and subtler. But I think I liked Al Pacino's Godfather performance more then Marlon Brando's. The Cinematography and Production Design are great. The Staging and Blocking look great especially in that early search sequence. The Score got better. I thought there would be more Robert De Niro,‚Ä¶

5062 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   A great, great sequel that lives up to the expectations created in the first movie.The Godfather: Part II just keeps on giving you that bittersweet feeling that's familiar to the franchise, with so many shootings, betrayals and actual jumpscares that you're unable to predict what is coming next. And that's just something you can't get enough of because it's so excellently executed.It may have an incredibly long run-time, but I believe every minute is absolutely worth it simply‚Ä¶

5064 so good. but part 1>>> 
5065  Al Pacino displays a menacing presence throughout the film, but if I‚Äôm being completely honest Robert DeNiro as the young Vito Corleone was by far the best part about this film. I understand that this trilogy is focused on Michael, but the first one is outstanding because you see him change as he rises to power. In this one he‚Äôs already been through that change, and there isn‚Äôt much else done besides the menacing presence to keep me interested in‚Ä¶  
5066 ‚ÄúMy father taught me many things here - he taught me in this room. He taught me: keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.‚ÄùEven if it is a continuation rather than a sequel, The Godfather Part II is equally as good, if not better, than its predecessor. Honestly, I just wish it was longer.

5069 Despu√©s de todo el viaje que resulto esta pel√≠cula el flashback de la mesa al final me resulto muy doloroso, por cuanto las cosas han cambiado. 
5070 This month I decided to watch all three Godfather movies. This is obviously the second part of the franchise. The last time I watched parts one and two, I actually thought this was the better of the two. This time around I am back to thinking part one is better. Saying this is not better than one of the best movies of all-time is not really too bad of review. Still a great movie. I wonder if it will rebound to the top spot when I re-watch these movies again.Ranked 2nd of 54 movies on our UMR Al Pacino Movie Ranking Page. www.ultimatemovierankings.com/al-pacino-movies/ 
5071 they had congress hearings omg its just like succession guys 
5072 When the intermission appeared I felt a sence of joy for a second before the movie immediately continued for another 7 hours 
5073 Getting to see this in the cinema was simply amazing. Possibly the only chance I might get and one I won't forget any time soon.It is a testament to man's hubris that we still make films after this. This perfected the art form and that we didn't just pack it up after this was made is crazy. 
5074  'I knew it was you... I knew it was you and you broke my heart'That moment of rage and pain breaking from the tortured Michael Corleone comes like a torrent, and always sends¬†a chill down my spine. The Godfather Part II sees Michael slip further and further from the warm, amused man who attended that wedding with Kay (Diane Keaton) at the start of the original film, as his need for power takes the Corleones to new heights in‚Ä¶  
5075 The best sequences in both films are hands down the Italian ones. Captures a portrait of Italy that I‚Äôd love to live in minus the mob bosses. Watching on a big screen is an incredible experience! 
5076 I had forgotten how long and slow the deterioration of this family is. And I think that‚Äôs the saddest part for me! The contrast of young Vito‚Äôs more virtuous reasons for starting a ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù against Michael‚Äôs constant grasping for control is incredibly depressing. 
5077 A perfect sequel?A perfect prequel?The Godfather Part II does it all. A complex story with character development that respectfully builds on Part I. At the centre is a heartbreaking contrast. Vito building his family and Michael losing his. A powerful drama that is every bit the achievement as the first. Which is better? Only personal preference can split them. 
5078 First shot of Al Pacino‚Äôs beautiful face on the big screen made me say ‚Äúoh my god.‚ÄùWhen the film finished I turned to Isaac and said ‚Äúit‚Äôs like watching a man destroy his soul.‚Äù¬†Michael, you idiot.De Niro eats it up.

Si El Padrino es de por s√≠ ya una obra maestra, a esta segunda parte directamente se le puede llamar una obra de Dios mismo; es una cinta brutal que nos muestra la evoluci√≥n de Michael y su ascenso al poder, as√≠ como tambi√©n, el comienzo de su final.

5091  For me this might not have been the best film I have ever seen. I felt overwhelmed by it at times and I'm now really at loss of words. But it's a masterpiece nonetheless. I'm not even starting on cinematography as we all know that this film is literally flawless and so good-looking. The story itself was merely semi-import. This is more of a character study. I found myself twisted. Not knowing who to sympathize with. It was really interesting‚Ä¶  
5092 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  "I know it was you Fredo, you broke my heart". If anyone ever betrays me imma do that shit. Stone fucking cold. Me and a couple of friends started up our own Italian Mafia in the town. We're not big into the business and killing stuff but we make sure to stay true to the Italian culture (cheek kissing, hugging, lip kissing etc.). One time one of the buttons was being real disrespectful and I had to give him a blowjob.91/100  
5093 Michael Corleone is one of the greatest characters of all time.

5100 I watched this for the second time a couple of days ago and it‚Äôs still just as good as the first time I saw it. Although a lot of parts in this are some of the best in the whole trilogy, the first one is the best since it is more rewatch able. I still love the ending scene. 
5101  The first is better when it comes to structure and storytelling, but the second is better in every other way. The scope and tragedy is as ambitious as it gets, covering more ground then the first film. I wonder how people felt at the time when the sequel was being made? Were they excited or upset, because if a Godfather-tier movie was made today and got a sequel, a lot of people would be moaning about it. I guess the‚Ä¶

5105  Movies lost me to prestige TV for a little while. Huge casts of characters with multiple conflicting arcs seemed exciting! But eventually, flaws became apparent. Writers' rooms with only vague ideas about where the plot should end up would write themselves into corners, then drop plotlines entirely. Stories that seemed propulsive at the time now look aimless. I've had my fill. I'm back to the perfect little nuggets of story you can get in a film of 2-or-so hours.I‚Ä¶  
5106 i could fix michael corleone <3 kidding aside though, i loved this more than the first one. it's just so heartbreaking and breathtaking, especially the alternating of scenes between vito and mike. never thought i'd want more of it even though it's over 3 hours long. 
5107 ' If there's one thing that's certain in life and history has taught us, that we can kill anyone ' .Character Arc of Michael Corleone is enough to tell how masterful the writing and this movie is .

Sprechen kann man von diesem Film nur in Superlativen. Erinnern wird man sich f√ºr immer.

5112  Though the the intercuts between Vito's story and Michael's story deflate some of the palpable tension, the films teeters on the line between "long and boring" and "masterpiece", before eventually falling into the latter.The masterfully constructed scenes, majorly painted in various orange themed hues, convey the assertion of strength in adverse times.

5116 I feel like this is sort of an unbalanced movie, the first two halves have some pretty exciting sequences like the assassination scene with younger Vito and the Cuban Revolution scene with older Michael. It's not that this grinds to halt with drama, the tension that leads to Fredo's death on the boat is so painful that it is hard to watch. Perhaps this is a sequel that is better than the original, but Part One is much more watchable. 
5117 i feel like a lot of people who watch this film severely overlook the fact that that the cuban revolution ended on the new year‚Äôs day of 1959 
5118  This movie gets better every time, each viewing I get more and more out of it. The first film is an incredibly difficult triumph to surpass, yet the second part managed to do it.

5121  MICHAEL CORLEONE'S UNSTABLE PEAKFrancis Ford Coppola repeats the mastery of a couple of years ago and brings the distortion of the family ideology, a criminal epic that ends in the son's betrayal to his family and his own father's legacy. The director knows how to surprise again by dividing his story into 2 timelines to meet a couple of objectives: the first, to set apart roles and personalities by uniting the present and the past, the son's actions together‚Ä¶  
5122 Picking between Part I and II is legitimately impossible. Not better than Part I like some people say though.

5128 A deeply felt echo of despair and sadness lines the hollow walls of this tragic portrait of American greed and capitalism corrupting and destroying a man who could not handle the shoes he stepped into, juxtaposed against the father who built that empire decades earlier, and the fluctuating perspectives of these two men. One rises and one crumbles. An immigrant manipulates the American dream as he comes to power, while his American born son becomes cursed with that burden. Slow, quiet and haunted. Would make a good double feature with The Irishman, if you've got 7 hours to kill. 
5129 I'm doubly impressed.

5133  The mafia dealings of The Godfather Part II almost fade into the background when compared to the flashier violence of Part 1, leaving behind a deeper, more introspective character piece that expertly chronicles the rise of Robert DeNiro‚Äôs Vito Corleone & the beginning of the end for Al Pacino‚Äôs Don Michael Corleone.Making this both a prequel and a sequel was a masterful move in my eyes, because the contrast in events from one timeline forces you to reevaluate your feelings‚Ä¶

My one complaint (if it can even be considered a complaint) is that there was not enough de Niro. Every second he's onscreen, he embodies Vito Corleone and commands your attention. He's so damn good and at times, it seems like it's effortless to him. 
5137 Telling the waiter ‚Äúmake sure everybody sees the cake before we cut it,‚Äù forcing him to bring it around to every single guest for a quick look, is the most gangster shit I‚Äôve ever seen 
5138 2 or so hours of plot development, then "Intermission," and then 80 or so minutes of incredible dread and melancholy and anxiety? Prequel-ish stuff like "the origin of Vito liking oranges?" Almost dark cinematography? There is nothing like this film. I don't even know why it works! I can tell you that I want to start watching it more often now. 
5139  Incredible sequel... In fact probably one of the best sequels ever made. In my mind it's right up there with the likes of 'Before Sunset' and Satyajit Ray's 'Aparijito'. Films that aren't made for profit and that drag on a story unnecessarily, but breathe new life into an already existing piece of art.Part II of the Corleone saga begins with the first ever piece of characterisation of Vito Corleone in a flashback to when he was nine years old‚Ä¶

5144 89The longest movie I‚Äôve ever seen.Apt review?I don‚Äôt know...there‚Äôs a lot to love - Pacino gets better, De Niro‚Äôs pretty fantastic, and a lot of it works more aesthetically dynamic than the first (I.e. globetrot that‚Äôs tenfold more interesting). Family is still family, but I dunno, maybe it feels like I should‚Äôve watched this earlier so that the more traditional elements don‚Äôt feel so vanilla when they were pretty much pioneers all those decades ago. Am I dubious? No, not really. Just kinda bored. 
5145 IN MY HOME! IN MY BEDROOM! WHERE MY WIFE SLEEPS?!?! so true michael 
5146 Greatest sequel of all time? Not all sequels can be better than there predecessor but Godfather Part II does just that. Another great story and great performances. De Niro steals the show.

5150 This is now in my top 3 of all time for sure and Pacino as Michael Corleone is probably my favorite performance ever.¬†Very very anxious to see part 3. 
5151 although i liked the first one more, this is still a fantastic film! the acting in this was beautiful. it felt like everything that was happening was real!

5153  A successful follow up to the fantastic first film. Godfather Part 2 does everything right to build on the characters and story from the first. With both being directed by Francis Ford Coppola, the film keeps its same tone and themes throughout. While being about 3 hours and 30 minutes, I was never bored as the time past.¬†My favorite aspects of this film was the addition of young Vito Corleone played by Robert De Niro.

5154  Ughh, qu√© complicado esto. A ver, la comparaci√≥n es innevitable. Veo a esta secuela como la ant√≠tesis de la primer pel√≠cula. Mientras The Godfather nos introduc√≠a desde la familia al crimen, The Godfather Part II comienza en el crimen m√°s ac√©rrimo para, poco a poco, adentrarse en el drama familiar m√°s profundo.  Es una secuela mucho mejor en t√©rminos de gui√≥n, en fotograf√≠a, en direcci√≥n e incluso en profundidad. Sin embargo, pesa. El ritmo implacable que ten√≠a la primer entrega‚Ä¶  
5155 Huge shoutout to my dad who had to translate HALF the movie because HALF the movie is in Italian and we had Russian subtitles on. Unlike most movies, I dreaded seeing Robert De Niro because it meant 10 more minutes of Italian which my dad translates into Russian, a language I somehow went my entire life pretending that I understand. Good movie, glad this was my first time watching it! Part 3 here we come!Update: Finally got through to Letterboxd to have them correct the cast list!

5157  I prefer part 1, mainly because it Marlon Brando and his presence ¬†but holy fuck was this a perfect movie.Both Al Pacino and Niro are phenomenal in this movie. Michael and Vito Corleone are truly two of the best written characters ever. I do edge Al Pacino for best performance but again both were brilliant.¬†Michael Corleone‚Äôs character is so brilliantly emotionally complex. He becomes so consumed by violence and negativity in the end. I think that‚Äôs what makes‚Ä¶  
5158 look, all its praise is rightly deserved. this is an incredible movie. i will plead the fifth every time on which one is better, i think that‚Äôs one of the most redundant arguments in pop culture.¬†that being said, this is possibly the foremost illustration of the illusion¬†of American exceptionalism. i had never seen this before and didn‚Äôt know what lens to view it through, but it‚Äôs abundantly obvious as soon as Vito arrives in America.

5160 Empires are built on blood. The American Dream is cut-throat, cruel and immoral. 
5161 : ‚ÄúKeep your friends close, but your enemies closer.‚ÄùPuzo and Coppola deliver again with this epic sequel to the greatest crime film ever, you can count on one hand sequels that are equal to their predecessor or even surpass them and must be right at top of that list. Pacino is on fine form as the more vindictive Michael Corleone, but it‚Äôs De Niro who shines the brightest as the young Vito Corleone. What a brilliant casting call that ¬†was , also quite clever how the film is split perfectly ¬†between the two Corleone stories. Roll on part 3. 
5162  to get it out of the way: robert de niro and al pacino made several points. but my god i feel sick for michael corleone. i haven‚Äôt a clue if the book provides more of an internal monologue, more feeling the way the third act does, but if that‚Äôs the case i need to get on it. the cold and calculating thing with michael is a lot more difficult to digest with the third act (the best act, i think‚Ä¶  
5163  The Godfather movies are really like the acting olympics. Just too many good performances to count. Pacino, Keaton, Duvall, Cazale, and De Niro just to name a few. So many other great supporting performances and characters that play key to this movie. I think that this movie is better than the first Godfather movie. I like the two parallel stories of the rise of Michael and the rise of Vito. You can see the contrast between the two and how‚Ä¶

Particularly his performace is incredible in the scene where Kay admits to the abortion.+De Niro's performance as a younger Vito is perfect.

5165 holy shit guys 
5166  How does one even start talking about The Godfather: Part II? Truth is, you can't. Everything that made the original fantastic is just as present here, if not more-so. I find it gets bogged-down more with its inner politics (given that 3 and a half-hour running time), but let it be known: this is a very different film than the last one. Whereas Part I is a streamlined, sweeping epic about loyalty and the rise of power, this one is‚Ä¶  
5167 takes the original godfather and expands upon it perfectly. a beast of a fucking film. perfect. 
5168  Well, it‚Äôs The Godfather Part 2. Need I say more?Actually, I should. You might remember me saying in my review for The Godfather how ‚ÄúAl Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall all (deservedly) got nominated for Best Supporting Actor at the 1973 Oscars. So I‚Äôm wondering if there has been any instance since then of the Oscars giving 60% of their nominations in any category towards one film‚Äù? Well, there was another instance of that happening... The Godfather Part‚Ä¶  
5169 Al Pacino's Michael Corleone is one of the best performances you'll ever see. The splicing of the Michael timeline with the Little Italy of Vito is beautiful and the silent Robert De Niro is mesmerizing. The Cuba sequence doesn't feel tacky and the party scene down there is amazing. You realize on the rewatch how great John Cazale is in this movie and how little time he has in the first one.  It ain't the way I wanted it! I can handle things! I'm smart! Not like everybody says... like dumb... I'm smart and I want respect!  
5170 The last one at the table.Should I see the third one? I don‚Äôt know. This one just stands so supreme in my mind. This is just cinema from concentrate. So so good. 
5171  It's amazing that you can step down so much with a sequel. The main points of the film are there, but this is just not even close to being on par with the first film. The film itself seems to be about all that Michael can't give his family, and why they hate him for it. His sister hates him because she has no financial independence from him (though this is actually because she is entitled), Fredo hates him because‚Ä¶  
5172 pretty good you guys 
5173 just wanted to pay tribute to how absolutely perfect and raw and heartbreaking john cazale's performance is in this film. so many of the emotional beats would fail to hit if the audience didn't love fredo and that's entirely down to him 
5174  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel I have to wipe everybody out Tom. Just my enemies.‚ÄùGod, I love this film. It‚Äôs undoubtedly a masterpiece, not only is it on par with ‚ÄòThe Godfather‚Äô in my opinion it¬†surpasses it in every regard.The approach this film takes of showing two parallel storyline of father & son is absolutely fascinating, especially when those characters are as legendary as Vito & Michael Corleone.

It seamlessly combines‚Ä¶  
5176 Michael, your father loves you very much. Very much.Unbelievable.Truly, a perfect movie. Unlike anything I have ever seen before.¬†I don‚Äôt think there is a proper way for me to review this without undermining it‚Äôs brilliance. From the top to the very end, I didn‚Äôt want a second of the movie to feel short. I‚Äôve never wanted a movie to be endless so badly before.Spectacular.I know it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart. 
5177 More ambitious, patient, and bleak. To me, this film stands on par with the first film in terms of quality, but overall I'll say I still prefer the first one.Also, it's insane that Gordon Willis wasn't nominated for Best Cinematography in the first 2 films. 
5178  Everyday I repeat the same 4 lines from this masterpiece, which are:- I know it was you fredo. You broke my heart!- an abortion Michael! Just like our marriage is an abortion. Something that's unholy and evil!- in my bedroom, where my wife sleeps!... Where my children come and play with their toys- I just don't feel i have to wipe everybody out, Tom. Just my enemiesI can't help it.I want to mention that‚Ä¶  
5179 Without any doubt one of the greatest sequels in cinema history. More of a character study which culminates in an ending which is Shakespearean in time. Pacino in GOD MODE. 
5180 if you catch me sleeping during the godfather part two mind your own fucking business 
5181 young Al Pacino can get it 
5182 As much as I loved watching this film, I couldn't help thinking that a movie simply about Michael Corleone's troubles as the Don or Vito's journey up the ranks of the criminal underworld would be equally as thrilling and fascinating - but of course this film still delivers phenomenal cinematic technique and grandeur so I cannot complain. I suppose that in this case, you can't have too much of a good thing. 
5183  I'm a Cuban woman - a dancer - working in an American-owned club in Havana. It is the eve of the revolution, and the air is thick, effervescent with fear and cautious hope.

It will change the course of Cuban history. But tonight feels different for another reason. Tonight,‚Ä¶  
5184 Pretty cool feeling when you get to one of the best movies ever made and have nothing smart, interesting, or fun to say about it.

5186 Watched this with my parents (their first viewing and my 50th) and they were completely enraptured - which is really saying something considering it was the uncut cable version so thats like 4.5 hrs easily after commercials FUCKING ADVERTS but yeah long live one of best sequels ever made 
5187 Thank you for this Al Pacino acting legend 
5188 michael in court: how could i have done any of these crimes? im babyme who knows he did the crimes: damn...hes right. 
5189 Going off the fact that The Godfather was a perfect masterpiece, I was blown away at how the sequel (maybe the best sequel of all time) actually triumphed over the original. Al Pacino and Robert De Niro (who absolutely deserved the Academy Awards for best supporting actor) take on parallel storylines that show how ruthless young Vito Corleone could be and how much more his son (the new Don) could be, even towards his own brother. 
5190 al pacino was so hot in this 
5191 It feels too schematic in its construction and too blatant in its thematics. Not that the first part was really a subtle film in that regard, but this just hammers its point home really hard. Also tries too hard to be a sequel (read: imitates the first part too much) and although it does expand a bit upon certain aspects of part 1, it ultimately doesn‚Äôt really introduce any interesting new ideas itself. Also, Don Vito‚Äôs plot¬†feels kinda pointless at the end of the day. 
5192 Everyone is allowed to have their own opinions but this is literally the best movie ever made 
5193  Just the slightest step down from The Godfather, but in comparing it to footsteps, it's more like a single step than the whole flight of stairs. The prequel-sequel hybrid narrative is really what brings things down just that much: as unique of a narrative device it is, and how well it juxtaposes its two protagonists, it sometimes feels like Coppola is biting off just a bit more than he can chew compared to the far more streamlined narrative of The‚Ä¶  
5194  I'm a little unsure at the moment, after all watching these two 3 hour movies back-to-back sort of made them blend into one awesome epic, but you know what I think I just might prefer this to 'The Godfather'. Maybe its just because I was reaching the end of this saga (yes I know theres a third but I hear its sub-par), I found myself getting quite emotional towards the end of Part 2. I think thats because its a‚Ä¶  
5195 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   If anything in this life is certain if history has taught us anything, it is that you can kill anyone.It's no secret that 72' Godfather disappointed me and left a sour taste in my mouth. I thought I'd like it, but it turned out to be a very monotonous and boring journey. As for this film, The Godfather II is an entirely opposite experience. Coppola's 1974 film did everything the first wasn't able to do. This film isn't afraid‚Ä¶   
5196  I might be biased considering I am an Italian man, Al Pacino is my real father, and him and I share the same nose size and nose shape but this movie slaps you in the teeth so hard that by the time the ending rolls up 3 hours later, you can smell the cannolis and pasta cooking in the kitchen. You're not Italian? This movie will make you become one by the end. As I type this review my mamma‚Ä¶

5200 This movie did something incredible, it's on par with the first one. 
5201  If The Godfather is a chronicle of the Corleone family, The Godfather Part II is about their end. True, it is also about their beginnings, but those flashbacks serve more as a eulogy; a remembrance of what the Corleone family once were and a tragic reminder of what has been lost. This tragedy is further found in Michael's arc, which is a further descent into brutality, and Al Pacino's searing performance. He's cold, but there is real rage bubbling beneath‚Ä¶  
5202 SO GOOD! Gives Empire Strikes Back a run for its money. 
5203 Like its predecessor, The Godfather 2 is an absorbing, epic experience. I sat in front of my television screen for more than three hours, but it really only felt like a few minutes. I can't really say which one of the first two movies I like better, but the last few minutes of TGf2 were for me the best moments of the entire saga. 
5204  The Godfather Part II is an almost flawless sequel to its fantastic predecessor, The Godfather. This film contains absolutely incredible performances from the entire cast, an emotional and perfectly told story and fantastic direction and cinematography. This one of the best made films ever just like the first one. Although it's tough to choose which one is better, they're both masterpieces and there is no denying that. The story of younger Vito Corleone was also so interesting and it never‚Ä¶  
5205  The New Years Resolutions - Film #27(Coppola 2/5)The scale is bigger. The budget is larger. The run-time is longer. But is the film better? I couldn't really say.On almost all accounts this is another Coppola masterpiece; the story-telling is pure and clear, the performances are magnetic and the overall look is gorgeous (Everything set in 1900's America is stunning). I love the ideas that Puzo and Coppola attempt to explore here; not only is this the story‚Ä¶  
5206 It took me a really long time to figure out that I found the De Niro flashbacks so much more compelling and superior to the shenanigans in Nevada because the warm, seductive olive light of that line is almost hagiographic. The blues and beiges of Michael's world are either too cold or too sickly, striving without feeling. Because a man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man. You're a bastard, Gordon Willis. 
5207  Talk about a sequel that nailed everything! Let's talk about The Godfather Part II. This is literally one of the most difficult films to create. Thankfully, Coppola did have a source material to look to but seeing how perfect everything about the original was, it would be difficult to even near the original and thank god, The Godfather comes very close to topping the original and in some aspects, does top it!Talking about performances, every single casting choice is‚Ä¶  
5208  The question as old as time itself...since about the mid 70's...Which is better, The Godfather or its counterpart?The Godfather Part II is about as tightly wounded as films can get, it's damn long yet it never wastes any of it's time. The structure is a tad strange, split between Vitio and Micheal to create a similar narrative path between the two, yet giving you huge chunks of the stories at once, but only a minor complaint to the‚Ä¶

Wie auch schon im ersten Teil sind alle Charaktere gut geschrieben und machen eine nachvollziehbare Entwicklung durch.

5216 The most supremely overrated sequel of all time which amplifies the vast faults of its predecessor. Plot is non-existent. Story flow is horrifically muddled with its double-narrative structure: the Vito plotline adds nothing to the film and bogs down an already overlong film, while the Michael plotline is profoundly dull and convoluted. Has some plot holes and contrivances. Fredo's turn is revealed early in the film, undercutting subsequent drama. Most sequences are tediously drawn out and Pacino's acting is often too dreary. Another foul boring mess of a crime drama. Rating: F 
5217  A fantastic sequel to another fantastic film. Whenever I watch these films I can't help but compare the first to this, part 2 as I see them in lists all the time, never with a clear winner. I believe that this film is fantastically acted, with standout performances from Pacino, De Niro and the late John Cazale and a great story that really compounds the first film.However.

5230 Al Pacino this, Martin Scorsese that... overrated. 
5231 Imagine watching this in a theater. That would be an out-of-body experience. 
5232  Wow. I am definitely a Godfather Part II type of person. Al Pacino is just captivating in every way. The way he can transform himself to have a different personality and physicality while playing the same character is especially evident in the last scene. The way he can go from being in his mid 20s to his 50s just by a facial expression (and a few gray hairs) is remarkable. After Michael becomes the don, the movie just¬†becomes about how‚Ä¶  
5233  üíØ100% A+Summary:The sequel to 1972‚Äôs The Godfather, which follows both the rises of power of Michael & Vito Corleone and how Michael goes through many tragic events while Vito starts the beginning of his life of crime.My Thoughts:Wow, what a masterpiece this film is. It amazed me in terms when you look at how it really pays attention to character arcs along with lighting & camerawork. There‚Äôs specific shots such as one wide shot that has a window‚Ä¶  
5234 I don't know if I liked this one more just because I watched both in a row and thus I was more attached to the characters or what. Anyway, this movie is epic in every way, also in its length, but I could have been watching it for another three hours.And as person who has fucked many things up: Fredo deserved better. 
5235  [Up from 3.5 stars. I like it more than I used to, and I had to give more credit for how well executed this movie really is, but The Godfather will always be better in my eyes. Part II's plot is too involved and hazy, and I'm too aware of its runtime. The first film relayed outright Vito's and Michael's characterizations, so three-and-a-half hours of embellishment seem unnecessary. Besides, almost all the power of Part II is predicated on the‚Ä¶  
5236 The Godfather part 2, ah more like¬†The Garbagefather Fart 2, atrocious in every sense.

All they do is talk and talk and this is an Italian Movie, but where‚Äôs the ninja turtles!?!? big no no0.3/10 
5237 Well, I liked it better than the first one, but man, what a depressing movie. 
5238 Probably the best dramatic sequel ever made. 
5239  Um irm√£o abra√ßa o outro, perdoando todos os seus erros. A m√∫sica cresce, tornando a cena extremamente emocionante. Perd√£o e amor fraterno arrebatadores em um dos grandes momentos do cinema. Mas basta um olhar de um desses irm√£os para o capanga que est√° por ali e a trilha sonora perde seu √≠mpeto, esmorece. A cena t√£o emocionante que acabamos de ver √© uma mentira do diretor, criada para refletir o mundo de hipocrisia em que vive o seu protagonista. √â‚Ä¶  
5240 Top 3 Nevada film of all time 
5241 Lost a half-star because it‚Äôs no Shrek 2.¬† 
5242 Still a dance of death, but part II keeps my attention and interest more than part I. This instillation of a Prequel/Sequel, weaves the two stories well and if it's even possible, adds some humanity in the mix. I say that skeptically, since it's just so hard to find amongst the bloodshed. Eye for an eye code of contact through the generations, plays before me like a hellscape. There's no one to trust, really, and the chance of being offed, or a family member being taken out, is always there. It's all so pointless, but who could ever escape the macabre scene? 
5243  these are pretty much the same movie for me. i wanted to love this movie soooo bad u don‚Äôt even understand. with that being said, i probably prefer the 1st one MAYBE just a bit more, just cause i thought it was a bit more unique, and cuz i loved Vito, but regardless this was damn near just as good.¬†im not even gonna hold you, i may have fallen asleep for like 5 minutes during the middle of the‚Ä¶  
5244  The midfather part 2. Unfortunately, I finally got around to watching this sorry excuse of a documentary. To put it delicately, this just wasn‚Äôt good. My first of many criticisms is that it wasn‚Äôt nearly long enough. With a screen time of just over three hours , I felt utterly scammed. It‚Äôs a mystery to me how this documentary comes in the form of a mere trilogy. With the poor pacing and the minuscule length of each one, I‚Äôm shocked‚Ä¶  
5245  Man, I can't really tell if I like this more than part 1 or not. I think part 1 just surprised me more. There's more shocking scenes in it. But this is still deserving of a 10 and i respect the hell out of both of these movies. The cast is great again. Al Pacino continues to be great, John Cazale is great as Fredo (fucking Fredo), and I really liked seeing a young Robert De Niro as Vito.Honestly‚Ä¶  
5246  It's a testament to how insanely good this movie is that I have a difficult time deciding between Part I and Part II of The Godfather. I end up falling on the side of the original, but it's extremely close. Part II has this massive, epic feel that is so ambitious yet so precise. It's the sort of movie that really couldn't be made today - it's incredibly long, unhurried, but still engaging throughout. I was struck by how unique‚Ä¶  
5247  Yesterday I revisited the first Godfather and I still think it's a true masterpiece.Although I find Vito Corleone's speech a bit distracting (no wonder on Animaniacs in the Goodfeathers clip, they do a parody of Vito where he just babbles xD) overall I find it impeccable.I will admit that this installment is a step up from the first, where Mickey temperately carries on his father's legacy, the burden of being the godfather while looking at Vitto's past.Tom,‚Ä¶  
5248  I still prefer The Godfather over Part two, but the journey I've been on with this film over the years is a great one. I started off not really liking it; then I started to respect it; then I admitted it was almost one of the greatest films ever made; and now I just flat out agree that it is. I think it definitely does take a few watches to truly apriciate this epic, but there's so many ritch and‚Ä¶  
5249  Surprise surprise another film I misjudged. To be honest think having the DVD over streaming helped, as I find physical media helps with my immersion in movies. Don't ask me why it just does. Pacino was certainly robbed of an Oscar for this. If he won it for Scent of a Women, which was deserved, then he definitely deserved one for this and Scarface. Loved Diane Keaton and found the relationship between her and Pacino as one of the films‚Ä¶  
5250  after watching the first film yesterday, i am genuinely shocked and confused why everyone swore up and down to me that this film is the best of the trilogy. this film is aggravatingly self-indulgent and is unequivocally worse in my eyes. one of the key aspects that hampered my enjoyment of the first film is that the runtime was patently excessive. there was so much genuine filler and dead air in that film that i was annoyed at how much‚Ä¶

5258 young Robert De Niro and Al Pacino speaking Italian got me likeeeeee 
5259 I feel like the "realness" of movies gets taken for granted. Everything in these movies feels so real. Like a documentary instead of a movie. Everything is so lived in, the environments just feel natural. Something so easy to just accept but I know an insane amount of work went into making each and every detail. Astounding as always, but I think I'm definitely back in the 1 is better camp. 
5260  The Godfather: Part II still holds up to be one of my favorite films of all time. This film truly deserves all of the love that it gets. I still feel that this sequel is better than the first, since we get to see more character development. We see Michael's actions and change in character after taking over as the head of his family. Robert DeNiro's performance as young Vito is so impactful because we get to see a beautiful‚Ä¶

5265   MY 1000th FILM ON LETTERBOXD!!! The fact that I saw the first Godfather on almost 2 years ago and I have had this film on DVD for almost 2 years, why did it take me so long to finally see this movie, but I am also glad I saved this to be my 1000th film, cause boy oh boy this is now one of my  All-Time Favorite Movies . This film was just a masterpiece of cinema. I will admit‚Ä¶  
5266  Al Pacino delivers what might be the best acting performance I‚Äôve ever witnessed. His role as Michael Corleone isn‚Äôt just about delivering lines; it‚Äôs an entire language spoken through nuanced facial expressions and hand movements. This guy tells a million different stories without uttering a single word.Then there‚Äôs young De Niro stepping into the massive shoes left by Brando, and damn, he carried all the weight and more. He shows us a young Vito Corleone that not only respects‚Ä¶  
5267 I‚Äôve seen this movie so so so many times and my first watch was in pieces on TCM or something in my friends living room in high school.¬†Every time I watch it I wonder if it‚Äôs not going to be as good, but it is always somehow better.

5274  Finally fixed this scandalous omission.Follows on so well from the first movie. I‚Äôm sure that if you watched them back to back then you could be excused for wondering if they were all shot and made together.I do love Coppola‚Äôs direction and the way this has been edited. I always think the choice of shot is right, whether that‚Äôs more credit to Coppola or the editor I don‚Äôt know but it works well. Nino Rota‚Äôs distinctive and gorgeous‚Ä¶  
5275  As I sat there watching The Godfather: Part II, I sat calmly enjoying one of the greatest films ever made. Then all of a sudden Al Pacino snaps¬†yelling and it jolts me in my seat. It was like the movie told me to wake the hell up‚Äîone of the greatest performances in cinematic history plays right before you. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone is one of the greatest pieces of acting I‚Äôve ever seen. He is completely dominant on screen.‚Ä¶

Al pacino is so good in this movie man i can go on and on about his acting. 3hr‚Ä¶  
5281  A very important and excellently executed sequel that focuses on the back story of Don Vito Corleone and the story of how his son Micheal expands and tightens his grip on the family crime organization.

Now as in for the run time I‚Äôd say it was well paced but it did start to feel a little exhausting after a while so it‚Ä¶

5287 The complex storyline was far too confusing to me. But the cast delivered great performances, and i still managed to enjoy this movie even though it was very confusing. I will definitely rewatch this film to get a much better understanding of the movie and to write a in depth review. 
5288 Before, I thought this movie was significantly better then the¬†first Godfather¬†but on rewatch I now realise that you really can‚Äôt rank them because they‚Äôre both 2 completely different movies that are both incredible.

5297 i love robert de nero 
5298  Many movie buffs prefer The Godfather: Part II to its predecessor The Godfather, often hailing it as the best movie sequel ever made. I am not one of those viewers. Don't get me wrong. It is a great movie. But a film whose best parts are flashback sequences is a big weakness. Additionally, in the first movie, we see the amazing arc of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), as he goes from WWII veteran, "legitimate" civilian, and viewing his family's business‚Ä¶  
5299 There is a real argument to be made that this is the greatest movie of all time.‚ÄúBut by being strong for his family‚Ä¶could he‚Ä¶lose it?‚Äù 
5300 Just about as good as the first one. It's done just as well, and the Vito flashback sequences are awesome. I didn't enjoy the present-day stuff as much as I did in the original, but I did appreciate what it was going for. 
5301 I think I‚Äôm leaning to the first one ever so slightly, but what an excellent sequel. Watching Michael change and grow is becoming a bit of an obsession. This film never forgets the core themes of family, and presents that through two equally intriguing storylines about the father and the son. This is a damn masterpiece and is so carefully constructed and insanely tense. 
5302  Everybody knows what a great film this is. So I am not gonna say anything about the movie, rather a few facts about the film are1. During shooting in Cuba, Al Pacino become very ill, partly because of Cuba's harsh weather, and because of food poisoning.2. The Godfather 2 is the last Technicolor film.3. Marlon Brando and Robert De Niro are the only actors who received Oscars for playing the same character Don Vito Corleone.4. Robert‚Ä¶  
5303 these films always make me wonder how crime families ever have any members at all after watching them kill like half their friends family and associates

5305 i can fix him 
5306  Whilst the first examined becoming your father this sequel that also serves as the 1st's prequel is successfully seeks to show just how joyless the succession can be. Found to be a confusing and disappointing follow up to it's demanding predecessor at the time of it's release I can't deny how easy it would be to be confused. Juggling an origin story and the end of another was an ambitious choice Francis Ford Coppola utilizes in the best way through‚Ä¶  
5307 A better sequel than Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen 
5308  I don‚Äôt know if I like this one more than the first one, but FUCK I love this universe. I can‚Äôt put it into words how invested I am in these films. The whole message that family is the most important thing, and we should always stick up for each other, give each other a second chance, is something that I really appreciate. But of course this family is no good guys, and that‚Äôs what makes it all exciting. The‚Ä¶

5323 A perfect movie. The parallel rise and fall narratives of young Vito and Michael are fascinating. As Vito searches for community, his Italian culture is ubiquitous‚Äîlifting him up to craft his new identity as Don Vito and ultimately get revenge. Meanwhile, as Michael eliminates every person around him, his Italian heritage is disintegrating, slowly and deliberately.

5326 I hope the whole Oscar committee which was responsible for snubbing Al Pacino for Best Actor gets severely constipated if any of them are still alive.

Even though this movie is 3 hours and 20 minutes long, every minute is entertaining, enjoyable, and incredible. Francis Ford Coppola does an impeccable job at turning Mario Puza's masterpiece of a novel into a masterpiece of a movie. The writing is astonishing, I seriously can't believe it. This movie is almost perfect, I loved it. 9.8/10 
5331 Michael be like: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing I do better than revenge‚Äù 
5332 man FUCK michael corleone 
5333 que pel√≠culon !forever, in my opinion, the best film ever made, it just doesn‚Äôt get better than this, this film is a perfect representation of emotional, epic, gorgeously produced cinemanino rota also somehow tops his score for Part I, but i guess that goes for the whole film ;) 
5334  As good as the original, but we miss the striking presence of Marlon Brando. Here we know in parallel Michael's relentless descent into eliminating his enemies and losing his soul in the process, and we also see Vito's history and vendetta and his transformation into Don, which occurred in a very natural way. The restoration in 4k is perfect as if the film had been released yesterday! Reference in the format (as was also it's first remastering for blu ray).‚Ä¶  
5335 Damn, both Vito and Michael Corleone are still cold hearted bastards.¬†I really fought with myself on this one.At first I thought that it could be split into two different films, that it didn‚Äôt need to go for 3.5 hours, that it kept dragging on. I felt that during it, there were too many different scenes yet each of them had a purpose and place in the overall narrative.¬†As the narrative went on, the juxtaposition of the stories of father and son grow clearer, it‚Äôs becomes necessary that they be told together, side by side.¬†The rise and fall of a family. 
5336 This film is 3 and 1/2 hours, yet it's still an offer that I can't refuse. Ironic how Michael "didn't want to be his father" but eventually became worse than him. Killing the people around him, especially the people who cares about him, just to prove that nobody can defy him, the most powerful alpha man, has consequences. Karma really struck him hard, which we saw at the end of the film. Terribly tragic. 
5337 One of the captions during this was ‚Äú[Gibbering nervously in Italian]‚ÄùThe American Dream 
5338 would have gotten an extra half star if he showed Che lead the revolutionaries through Santa Clara ;)i think i liked this one slightly better than the first, or at least i have a feeling this one will have a longer-lasting impression on me 
5339 Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes and I was sleeping through the whole film 
5340 Baby Robert DeNiro, talk to me in Italian all day long... 
5341  Wasn't planning on watching this today, but I did. It's basically on par with Part I but it's also just way too long this time. Definitely wasn't as smoothly paced as Part I in my opinion. Don't get me wrong, it's an excellent film, it's just that its competition is its predecessor.I definitely appreciated how much more ambitious this film was however, it's basically a perfect sequel, expanding upon its characters and world in a fresh and interesting way.‚Ä¶  
5342  Watched Part 1 and Part 2 over the course of a week, taking intermissions every 40 minutes or so like it was a television programme. Works well given how episodic the format here is, and it is a nice way to break up a six-hour story that needs you keeping the details fresh in order to follow the whole arch of its fresco century ceiling - coming back to the second part months later would simply be a no-starter for‚Ä¶  
5343  Francis Ford Coppola‚Äôs double album of a film, The Godfather: Part II¬†is an absolute masterwork and I have no problem saying it‚Äôs superior to its predecessor.I was so enthralled watching Coppola‚Äôs hybrid prequel/sequel unfold with its parallel narratives. Robert De Niro and Al Pachino both give command performances in their respective roles. De Niro‚Äôs young Vito has such a soft presence. One that feels forgiving and forged in love but commanded with fear and respect in his rise to‚Ä¶  
5344 Now I loved the first Godfather movie, but this one just blew me away. Every aspect of this film is perfect. The acting is jaw-droppingly fantastic (with Al Pacino delivering one of my favorite performances ever), the cinematography is brilliant, the story is tragic and devastating, the writing is impeccable, the music is masterful, and the ending is crushing. Seeing all the characters develop and all their arcs resolve is one of the most satisfying things about this film. It‚Äôs a masterpiece of character work, and a masterpiece of film. 
5345 Vito went through all that and was still a better father to his kids than Logan roy 
5346  Ditches The Godfather‚Äôs traditional story structure for something more scattershot, though no less incredible. The first film in the Godfather saga is a younger person‚Äôs movie. During youth, all you do is look forward. Life seems on a perpetual upwards trajectory. The story is linear.The Godfather: Part II is the older, ruminative self. As you age, increasingly, you reflect on the past. How it made you who you are. Like Michael Corleone, spending more time staring off into middle‚Ä¶  
5347 THE GODFARTER PART TWO¬†my god this is so good i literally like it didn‚Äôt feel like nearly four hours üò≠ i really can never get over how amazing these movies are and how good the story is like it pulls you in from the start, which is rare to happen for meal pacino my beautiful italian kitten i‚Äôm always free if u want to chill xx 
5348  Finally got around to seeing the equally phenomenal sequel to one of my favorite films. It is astounding that they managed to make a sequel that is on equal footing with a film as perfect as The Godfather. Once again everything here is simply perfect and there really isn't any other way to describe it. I will say that I slightly prefer the first film to this one simply because that one is a bit smaller scale and I appreciated‚Ä¶  
5349 Meiner Meinung nach noch besser als das ohnehin schon perfekte Original, was nicht zuletzt an den Szenen mit Robert De Niro als junger Vito Corleone liegt. Gerade die R√ºckblenden verleihen den Film noch zus√§tzlich eine epische Breite.Und die letzte Szene ist ganz, ganz gro√ü. Muss dabei immer daran denken, was Michael zu Beginn des ersten Teils sagte: "Das ist meine Familie, Kay, das bin nicht ich." Drei Stunden perfektes Kino und definitiv eines der besten Sequels der Filmgeschichte. 
5350 ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt a miscarriage, it was an abortion‚Äù makes my fucking jaw drop every time. 
5351  I didn't see this comingI thought Godfather 2 would be something like the first one when i read the synopsis. Thought there will be intense writing involving crimes and the helf together Corleone family.Just like Irishman, this is a film which includes gangster not for their profession but for their personality and value for life, value for family, cold blooded actions, venomous nature.Irishman was more about the regression of a man's past sins.But this was just‚Ä¶  
5352 nobody told me this was so similar to peaky blinders what¬†jokes aside, this film is truly a masterpiece like the first one; the soundtrack, the cinematography, the acting just = chef kiss 
5353 Of course you learn a lot from watching these films, but what I didn't expect is to learn how to order a banana daiquiri in Cuba. 
5354 Way too much to unpack for a first watch. I will say that this whole film is just so beautiful looking and I loved spending my time watching this wonderful epic. 
5355 It's shocking that any director had any courage to make any film in any genre at any time after The Godfather was released. The peak was hit and a direct follow-up was an insurmountable feat. It's a classic for a reason as Coppola had reached Everest's summit and decided to keep climbing. Beethoven himself couldn't have performed an encore like this as he would have already busted out 5th Symphony in his first act. Phenomenal. 
5356 You don‚Äôt need a Letterboxd user to tell you this is as good as it gets but I have reasons to believe this is the highest achievement of art this far into history.¬†Coppola built and destroyed Rome over these two parts, and hell, he does all of that within this 3 1/2 hour motion picture alone.I‚Äôm forever grateful this was screening, best cinema experience I‚Äôll have. 
5357  Watched this in the cinema!!!:¬†- was really gearing up for it like it was DofE or something, chose my comfiest clothes, loads of snacks, caffiene, painkillers, the lot.- sat at the end of a one ended aisle so had to decide to not go for a wee, was weirdly proud of myself that I didn‚Äôt go for one once, despite being sat down for 4 hours. Seriously tho there‚Äôs an actual bit that goes ‚Äúintermission‚Äù and you know‚Ä¶  
5358 necesito leer el librooo 
5359 What a film. Such mastery displayed by Al Pacino as an actor; Michael manages to radiate such threat and conflict whilst barely raising his voice. His presence alone grabs all attention and is generally scary at times- when he walks in on Kay and the children; no words are needed. I think Vito has the distinction of being played by two of the finest actors of all time. 
5360 Todo en el cine es mejor. 
5361  The greatest sequel of all-time? Yeah, it‚Äôs in the conversation.Everything in The Godfather Part II focused on De Niro‚Äôs Vito Corleone origin story matches The Godfather‚Ä¶ firstly because it looks like a glorious painting in every single frame‚Ä¶ gazing on Lady Liberty from the ferry‚Ä¶ The Black Hand‚Ä¶ the rug (lordy, that scene)‚Ä¶ the hit on Don Fannuci‚Ä¶ the gutting of Don Cicci‚Ä¶Yet, everything with Pacino‚Äôs Michael Corleone, while still great in many ways, falls short of matching‚Ä¶  
5362 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Film 7 of 28 Number 3 on My February Watchlist ChallengeThe Godfather: Part II is an interesting story which both separates itself from Vito's story but also parallels it. What better way to live up to expectations of its predecessor than a story all about living up to the expectations of your predecessor. Michael now has all the power and money as his starting point. He looks to move the family operation out to Vegas and Cuba away from‚Ä¶   
5363 It‚Äôs still not better than the first one 
5364  "The Godfather: Part II" is a believable and exciting continuation of the story, simultaneously a prequel of sorts and a sequel to the original movie. I didn't find it as captivating and compelling as "The Godfather", but it's just as well-made, well-acted and emotional, and it adds more depth and complexity to the characters. I couldn't empathize with Michael as much, and I prefer the story and characters of the first movie personally, but this is still an amazing follow-up‚Ä¶  
5365 Think I could look at this all day. Beautiful sights to see 
5366  The Godfather Part 2 is a colossal and magnificent achievement. It‚Äôs especially more remarkable when you consider that there were only two years between this and the first film. Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola had to craft a massive screenplay, with the latter also directing another film (The Conversation) that was released in the same year as this.The result is a rich and complex story involving murder and betrayal, the intersection of vested interests and the leveraging of‚Ä¶

5375 The Godfather Part II is like two trains travelling in opposite directions, successive generations moving backwards and forwards through time until they meet somewhere in the middle around the dramatic flashpoint of the family dinner table. The film that marks the beginning of the Corleone family and the end of it is one of the most exquisitely structured pieces of fiction ever produced; its narrative and thematic arcs intertwining across vast stretches space and time through the macrocosm of history and the microcosm of memory. It is an epic of intimate proportions that fulfils the devastation that its predecessor prophesied.

5379  Despu√©s del √©xito de la obra maestra 'The Godfather", el dios Francis Ford Coppola, uno de mis directores favoritos, trajo "The Godfather Part 2". La mejor secuela en la historia del cine. La cinta tiene dos magn√≠ficas historias : La primera ocurre en 1958 y trata sobre Michael Corleone como el nuevo jefe de la familia. La segunda trama nos muestra la vida de Vito Andollini desde 1901 en Sicilia hasta ser "El Padrino" Don Vito Corleone. Primero que nada,‚Ä¶

Loved the way it ended and as always the soundtrack and acting is on point. De Niro and Al Pacino did a¬†TERRIFIC job!!! I still have yet to watch the last one which I will probably do tomorrow. I have a feeling the whole trilogy is gonna end up being in my top 5. Amazing movie. 10/10 recommend, go watch this movie rn! 
5388 need to take a few days off just to calm down... 
5389 I actually like this better than the first one 
5390 In which we see how the Corleone family is ill fated from the infancy of its patriarch‚Äôs life to forever be driven by rage, revenge, and a lust for power, under the guise of family values and honor. Has any other film so perfectly embodied the core aspects of American ideology as Coppola and Puzo did with this one? 
5391 It‚Äôs a classic mafia film. Love that it‚Äôs a sequel and a prequel all wrapped up into one. I‚Äôm not on board with thinking it‚Äôs better than the original but common that‚Äôs nearly impossible to beat. Love De Niro as Vito, and Pacino reprising his role as Michael. The movies that changed the game and laid the foundation for future great mafia movies to come. 
5392  While the first film is mostly a tale about family, reverence, and loyalty, this sequel aims attention to the exact opposite‚Äîindifference and dishonesty. The remaining of what once was a kind-hearted and honest man is completely gone. As Kay herself tells him, Michael's gone blind; either as the result of ambition or revenge. It's an inevitable descent into obscurity. A comparison's made between the early stages of his father and the current Michael concerning the topic of family: the creation‚Ä¶  
5393 About the same as Part I for me - boxd.it/1MbUWRFrancis gives good film 
5394  Though I greatly prefer the first part in The Godfather trilogy, there‚Äôs no denying that Part II is an epic continuation of the great tragedy of the life of Michael Corleone.¬†It is truly unfathomable how Pacino didn‚Äôt receive his first Oscar until a decade and a half after this film. This easily should have won him the Oscar. And while De Niro is good, I don‚Äôt necessarily think it‚Äôs Supporting Actor Oscar worthy. I would have given it to‚Ä¶  
5395 1974: The year Al Pacino first realized it's way cooler to yell your lines.Harry Dean Stanton makes everything better. Even if he just shows up for 5 minutes. 
5396 Arguably better than the first one but I‚Äôm not getting involved in that debate 
5397 "Michael, I never wanted this for you."Breathtaking. One of the greatest sequels ever made. 
5398 Great film but definitely has some issues with the length not entirely being justified. First one takes the cake overall for me. 
5399 I can tell I‚Äôm turning into my parents because I can‚Äôt help but get sucked into this movie in it‚Äôs entirety whenever I flip to it on TV. Possibly the greatest movie ever made? Al Pacino definitely gives my favorite film performance of all time here. 
5400 "keep your friends close and your enemies closer"in the part two of the epic trilogy (or duology, as francis ford coppola stated), we both see the reign of michael corleone and the beginnings of vito corleone. the rise of vito was paralleled by the beginning of the decline of michael's life. we saw more development of the characters from the previous film. coppola's directing is impressive ofc. al pacino still looks so fine here. he was joined by a stunning ensemble. the length of this was so intimidating at first but i found myself enjoying all throughout the film. 
5401  From one of the best films ever made to one of the best sequels of all time, The Godfather Part II has managed to stand outside of its older brother‚Äôs shadow with its own legacy, often being named itself as one of the best films ever made. Do I think it‚Äôs as good as the first? No, not exactly, the first is in my top 5 of all time, and while this is also a favorite‚Ä¶it‚Äôs not quite as perfect.‚Ä¶  
5402 I think I liked the first one better, but this isn't too far behind. Nonetheless, this is certainly a sequel that justifies its own existence and builds on all its characters from Part I. And can we just appreciate all the performances in this movie because they all were absolutely perfect. De Niro and Keaton do so well in this and even Duvall was great once again as Hagen. The music in this too was superb and helped with making this film the way it is.++ Fredo sleeps with the fishes now 
5403 the density of this film defies gravity 
5404 Holy shit, they got the guy from The War With Grandpa¬†(2020) for this one! 
5405 Great movie but it doesn‚Äôt compare to the first one imo. Al Pacino was phenomenal as usual. Robert De Niro was good but Marlon Brando as Vito did a way better job. I personally didn‚Äôt really like the flashbacks because I don‚Äôt they really needed to be there. The parts where it flash-backed to young Vito were just a bit boring. All in all, this is still a great film but the first one does just about everything better. 
5406 its Ok guys i can fix him 
5407 WHO eats an orange like THAT 
5408 I am amazed that a nearly three and a half hour movie felt like it was only an hour and a half. 
5409 Il secondo capitolo della trilogia del Padrino presenta i medesimi pregi tecnici del film precedente, optando intelligentemente per un'evidente continuit√† formale. A cambiare √® invece la struttura della narrazione, che sin dalla prima scena accosta l'ascesa di Don Vito (emblema del classico American Dream) alla tormentata solitudine di Michael. Un sequel che pur mantenendo i toni epici, non rinuncia a mostrare il lato pi√π intimo e oscuro dell'uomo solo al comando. Eccezionale l'attenzione prestata ai vari dettagli.

5414 I will never stop thinking about how much of a screen legend John Cazale would have been had he not passed away after only 5 films. Everyone is terrific, but he is the MVP of the movie for me.For what is often considered the greatest sequel ever, I still think its predecessor the better film. 
5415  What an amazing film and is probably one of the best sequels to a film ever, it perfectly serves as an antithesis to the first film and is so depressing by comparison. I really loved the flashbacks of Vitto as a young man and it was my favorite part of the film hands down.Is it as good as the first? In my opinion no but these are two very different films imo and serve separate functions so it's really‚Ä¶  
5416 Expanding the scope into a global conflict and utilizing an ingenious flashback structure, Coppola deepens what was so great about the first film. Through the story of one man growing increasingly distanced from his feelings, it matches its portrait of familial bonds and strife with an incisive look at the increasingly intertwined relationship between capitalism and criminal activity. The dissolves between 1910s Vito and 1950s Michael are so elegantly executed. They suggest, in their slow bleeding through time, the deeply ingrained beliefs that are passed on through generations and uphold entire nations. 
5417 My father is telling me about how it's the first time in the franchise they say "Mafia" and I'm more concerned about the guy saying "What's up?"Need a remake with the Muppets. 
5418 This is an obviously great and well-made and entertaining experience that is nevertheless- in my opinion- a lesser experience compared to the first film. Michael's arc here- where he's essentially morally ossified already- is less compelling than the previous gradual decline. Plus the Vito segments, although compelling, never fully cohere with the main narrative. This is only disappointing in direct comparison to its predecessor, however, and is otherwise a great accomplishment by any metric.

5420 M a s t e r p i e c e. - 5/5. 
5421  I think I prefer this to the first one. The Godfather is great but I was always a little uncertain as to whose film it actually was. The Godfather Part II works so well because it is very clearly Michael's film and everything that happens in the film serves Michael's arc. Al Pacino plays it to perfection and as a result we have this beauty of a film. As for the restoration (The Coppola Restoration is what I watched), I‚Ä¶  
5422 Call me old fashioned but I was raised to take care of my husband Michael. I wake him up with breakfast in bed everyday, I have a list of alibis prepared for him 24/7, I iron his suits, I pretend he didnt kill his brother. Hate all you want but I was raised to treat my husband like a king. 
5423  Though The Godfather is not a small film by any means, The Godfather Part II feels far more expansive. With two parallel stories that span decades and countries, the literary feeling sprawl is greater than the first film‚Äôs but, despite so many claims that it is the greater of the two and there being many parts I preferred, the original film still reigns supreme in my mind. Now that we know all these characters, becoming acquainted with their world feels‚Ä¶  
5424  In all my years I have yet to see the sequel to the masterpiece known as The Godfaja. I distinctly recall my Grandpa Sully, a casino host in Las Vegas who‚Äôs sole job was to take high rollers out for epic nights on the town to get them to keep gambling. I‚Äôd go and visit him in Las Vegas every few months.I was 9 years old. Hanging out with him on a quiet Saturday afternoon. We were watching a‚Ä¶  
5425 It must really be something to follow up on the biggest movie of all time and show "Oh no, we can expand the scope of its tragedy so much more than we showed you". I genuinely understand how the first Godfather is more beloved given that it's more easily watchable (I mean, that's the attitude I had when I first saw both movies) but The Godfather Part II is practically Shakespearean. Plus Gordon Willis shows that he can make his shadows heavier if so inclined and the past hazier if it can stress the difference between what was and the Hell that now is.

5427 Personally I enjoyed Part 1 a lot more. The more I think about both movies I realize how much I really liked the first one and how this one didn't click as well with me. But credit where credit is due, Part 2 is also a great movie and sequel, great acting and great dialogues, but with that said, the scenes I enjoyed the most where the ones with Vito and/or without dialogue, and most of the movie is heavily dialogue based and focused on Mike.

5437 on today's episode of jasper falling victim to being attracted to problematic italian men 
5438  First of all, I honestly still prefer Part I, but both of these movies are masterpieces and equally perfect and that they shouldn‚Äôt be compared to each other imo. Anyways...The Godfather Part II has a pure thematic gravity and an incredible amount of detail and information that the first doesn‚Äôt have imo, with its more complex plot, and how the present day story and the flashbacks interweaves perfectly. It sure is a brilliant sequel. It‚Äôs far more complexly beautiful‚Ä¶  
5439 Absolutely massive. A prequel and a sequel. De Niro and Pacino. New York and Sicily and Miami and Las Vegas and Havana. 3.5 hours long. This movie is big in every way and it‚Äôs great. 
5440  View Count: 1Well, it's still a drama that has quite a few moments that drag out, but I felt like I got a lot more from this than the first. Not as big of a fan of the first as it feels very shallow of content at times and not the best at keeping my interest. While this had those moments, it was less frequently.I had much more of the feel that lovers of the Godfather story probably‚Ä¶  
5441 This is like shit fuck good. The acting, directing, music, writing, and production design are beyond perfect. How did Coppola do this and the Conversation in the same year? 
5442  I've always had conflicted feelings with The Godfather: Part II; its predecessor is both a masterpiece and a perfect movie, a sentiment many people also have for its sequel, perhaps even in greater regard. I wish I could see it.This is a very good movie, and for its sheer scope, its ambition, and its craftsmanship, the entire film is immaculate, to the point that between this and its predecessor, I would actually argue that The Godfather: Part II is‚Ä¶  
5443 just look at Robert DeNiro's attempts to sound like Marlon Brando 
5444  Not gonna give it a star rating because I feel like anything less than 5 stars would, I dunno, lead to me being marked for death or something. I had never actually seen this all the way through in one sitting (I'd seen most of it in bits and pieces of the years). I think it's pretty good! And I know I'm supposed to view this as the second half of one continuous movie started by Godfather 1. And I‚Ä¶  
5445 If you have any question whether these are the dumbest motherfuckers in the world, just watch Michael Corleone try to eat an orange 
5446 im scared to watch godfather 3 now. is it just jersey shore. no don't tell me 
5447 Just watched this on 35mm in Melbourne, Australia and when they showed the Statue of Liberty I chanted U-S-A 
5448 young al pacino and robert de niro: me: you can make me an offer and I WILL NOT refuse 
5449 FIRST FILM OF THE YEAR FIRST FILM OF THE DECADE 
5450 *chefs kiss*the way al pacino makes me question my lesbianism... 
5451 Michael starts this movie a monster, and he ends it a monster, and all that happens is that it's made increasingly explicit to the audience. But holy cow, the look of those Vito in NY scenes is amazing! 
5452 I procrastinated getting around this for so long that two years after seeing the first one in theatres I was able to do the same thing for this 
5453  The best sequel and prequel in cinematic historyGodfather II highlights two different generations of the Corleone family, Vito and Michael.¬†The prequel tells a background story about a young Vito Corleone who immigrates to New York City from Sicily after the death of his family and the film later shows him as an adult before his legacy as The Godfather.¬†The sequel continues off where the first film ended, opening the film by showing Michael‚Äôs son first communion party‚Ä¶  
5454  So... a while back I granted five stars to the Wachowski's film, Bound. Generous, I know. But in a world where Bound is a five-star film, The Godfather Part II is a ten-star film. When a movie works on every level, making statements that encompass the personal, political, historical, and also manages to be a captivating piece of entertainment that carries the audience along through a narrative, we have a true work of art on the highest level.On top‚Ä¶  
5455 So many movies try to keep the quality in their respective first sequel and this one makes it look so simple,even more admirable taking into account that was adapted from a novel,the pace and involvement are superior comparing to the previous installment.Totally flawless. 
5456 just stunning. the Empire Strikes Back of sequels. 7/5 stars 
5457 wow i feel like i finally understand mamma mia: here we go again (2018) 
5458 i wish i could give you a coherent, well structured review of this masterpiece however my brain was frazzled the instant young robert de niro appeared on screen speaking italian 
5459 "Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer." 
5460 gotta say I found this somewhat underwhelming and disappointingit had some great moments but overall I feel like this doesn't really live up to the originalmy favourite bits were definitely the prequel stuff following Vito and I'm kinda sad that we didn't get as much of that compared to the somewhat dragged-out and hard to follow Michael storyline 
5461 god why do you have to pay to change your letterboxd usernamenow me and my friend katie can't change their username to reflect our true selvesI DEMAND TRANS RIGHTS @letterboxd 
5462  Checking another one off my cinematic shame list. The Godfather Part II is an entirely different animal than the first movie. It‚Äôs a sick film, and Michael Corleone‚Äôs corruption seems to radiate off of him and onto every single character. The plot itself seems warped by his evil. This isn‚Äôt the noble family of the first film, this Corleone clan is a dying beast, desperately trying to claw its way to survival. Cazale is given a lot more to work‚Ä¶  
5463 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   The Godfather: Part II has a structure based in flashbacks. While Part II is very much a sequel, exploring Michael Corleone's reign as The Godfather, it is also a prequel, exploring the beginnings of Vito Corleone's life of crime. Part II moves between past and present as effortlessly as 8 1/2 moved between reality and dream. But The Godfather: Part II's structure means more than narrative gimmick. It is essential to the trilogy, because with this structure, Coppola is given‚Ä¶   
5464  Se hizo esperar esta obra maestra pero finalmente pude verla , ya en los primeros del 2019 creo que va a ser dificil por no decir imposible ver una pelicula de este calibre , ya se convirtio en una de mis 5 peliculas favoritas sin dudas.Me gusto mucho mas que la primera aunque seguramente la revisione pronto , pero esta segunda parte es todavia mas oscura , muchas mas tramas y como esta contada la historia tanto de Michael‚Ä¶  
5465 One of the rare sequels that outdoes the original. 
5466 ‚ÄúI know it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart. You broke my heart!‚ÄùIt‚Äôs as good as everyone says it is.But dear god is it long.9/100 
5467 Keep your friends close & your enemies closer. Wow, this series is really impressing me beyond what I remember. I find it fascinating how the writing of the characters of the two different Godfathers are totally different. This and it‚Äôs predasesor are some of the greatest of all time. 
5468 5/5 [Masterpiece]Michael Corleone: My father taught me many things here - he taught me in this room. He taught me: keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. 
5469 i know the meme is dying but i'm just gonna say it:vito corleone invented big dick energy with this movie and i'm not gonna rest until everyone accepts this fact 
5470 Yeah, it‚Äôs better. Better in almost every conceivable way. 
5471 Part of Scavenger Hunt #41: August 2018Task #3: A sequel 'better' than the originalI honestly don't know if I'd consider this better than The Godfather, with the missing Brando, but boy howdy, that's a movie right there.Every actor is firing on all cylinders, not a single performance phoned in, and what gorgeous cinematography. Almost makes you wanna live in the gritty underworld presented.Almost.Minus a half star for not showing the guy from the Cuban nightclub show's massive dong. If you're gonna talk about it, might as well bump that MPAA rating up and deliver the goods. 
5472 Scope, baby. Pure scope.Having finally watched (and re-watched) these first two Godfather movies, it‚Äôs stunning to me just how many filmmakers would try and copy little bits and pieces of what made these films so excellent - and fail to capture it, any of it. This is absolutely everything you could ever crave and hope for in mainstream American cinema.Guess I‚Äôll put off seeing Part III for another twenty years! 
5473 if i have to see another woman get killed or abused in a movie i'll cancel all of cinema 
5474 Not sure if I've seen this in the last sixteen years, so even iconic moments had slipped from memory. For instance, when Tom Hagen informs Michael Corleone that Kay has had a miscarriage, I was all like, oh, that's quite sad.Anyway, my main takeaway is that the reason we lost nuanced Al Pacino is because he got sick of sound people complaining he wasn't talking loud enough to get a clean recording. 
5475 the way michael eats an orange in that one scene is honestly appalling 
5476 An absolutely amazing movie.But honestly: 3 hours 22 minutes - could not it have been a bit shorter? 
5477 At the risk of sounding like a complete dudebro, can i just say that watching this was equivalent to having an out of body experience. (Kisses fingers like an italian chef) poetic cinema 
5478 Michael to Fredo: What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I‚Äôll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I‚Äôve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I‚Äôm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. 
5479 What an epic filmCan‚Äôt believe this is as good if not better than the first¬†Pacino is cold as ICE#800 
5480 The Godfather: Part II comes very close to reaching the grand heights that the first made. Seamlessly connecting two stories in different time periods into one film. Despite it's 3 and a half hour run-time, the film never drags and it feels much shorter than what it actually is. Another masterpiece from Francis Ford Coppola. 
5481 anyway the scene where it dawns upon michael that it was fredo who betrayed him well and truly fucked me up. where is al's oscar already 
5482 That flashback at the end had me in tears.... these films are the definition of poetic cinema! 
5483  As with its predecessor, "The Godfather Part II" once again presents an image of crime, violence and mob life that is almost unnecessarily glorified. However, more mature viewers will be in awe of the complexity and richness of the characters portrayed, and the lengths to which the actors go to illustrate and foreshadow their emotions.Picking up around ten years from where "The Godfather" ended, the sequel shows Michael Corleone transformed into a ruthless mob boss who has as few‚Ä¶  
5484  Look maybe I'm an idiot, maybe I don't see the grand picture that has been baffling everyone for the past 40 years. I wanted to love this, I really did, The Godfather Part I had its flaws but it was still spectacular at parts, this isn't the same narrative. Seeing Vito grow up is great, I really enjoyed it, but every storyline with Michael is not so good. My biggest fault here is I think film misses some key pacing‚Ä¶  
5485 Film 6/30 of Scavenger Hunt #27Task #19- An Older Film One Of Your Local Theaters Is Screening This MonthOriginal list HereA sequel to one of the most coveted movies of all time, and it lives up to the hype. I find that I don't love these two as much as everyone else. But that doesn't mean I don't thoroughly appreciate them. 
5486  It's almost redundant writing a review on why this film is so great, yet here I am. I'm almost embarrassed that it took me 16 months after seeing The Godfather: Part 1, before I watched it's sequel. Part 1 is a film I've seen only once but it was such an experience that some of the film is unforgettable despite that single viewing. The real reason I had not got around to this until now is simply the film's length.‚Ä¶  
5487 Well there it is, I've logged 1000 films on LB, and I could not have watched a better film to celebrate that accomplishment.The Godfather: Part II is far more nuanced than its predecessor, and its non-linear storyline helps to highlight the similarities between Michael and Vito.Further. Robert De Niro is perfect as young Vito, and Al Pacino gives one of his best performances, beautifully understated, in this film.If other filmmakers should take any sort of inspiration from this film, it is to push themselves artistically with their stories, even if said stories are a continuation of a previous one. 
5488  Well, I went into this movie assuming that it was going to be a little bit better than the first Godfather film (because so many people had been saying that), but ultimately, I found that both films had just about the same quality. I'm not entirely disappointed though, because I did go into this movie feeling slightly apprehensive and doubtful that it would woo me, considering that the first Godfather film wasn't as good as I had hoped either. But‚Ä¶  
5489 Every bit as good as its predecessor, and arguably better. Part II isn't quite as flawless and airtight as the original, but it packs more of an emotional punch, and the dual storylines complement each other beautifully; the Vito-in-Little-Italy sequences in particular are fantastic. And for my money, no actor ever gave a better performance than Pacino does here. The full range of his talents is on display, and the rage and subtle menace, as well as the palpable regret, he projects, enthrall me. 
5490 I have no words on how amazing this movie is, I just love the godfather movies :')It's just... so beautiful.I'd give this movie 5000/10 if I could.‚Äî 10/10. 
5491 Not as good as the first for me just because I feel unclear about the plot (though the flashback was definitely fantastic). I guess it fleshes out the first one...basically showing the loss of Michael's family and stability as he drifts on his downward spiral into depression. Went faster than the first one, but felt more inconsistent in its intensity. 
5492 Pretty much the seminal crime saga. There's no getting passed it. 
5493 If you ever feel like you've been tasked with a difficult task that you believe is impossible to achieve...Just remember that Francis Ford Coppola made a sequel to 'The Godfather' that somehow managed to equal its predecessor. Dream big, kids. Nothing is impossible. 
5494 Unless you live under the world's biggest rock, you know exactly what this is: a flawless continuation of one of cinema's most revered stories, with Al Pacino delivering one of the greatest performances of all time as Michael Corleone. 
5495 Was it as good as the first movie? NoWas it still a fantastic film? Yes!Although it was far from being its predecessor, The Godfather: Part II was an amazing film. It's performances were great, the pacing itself was great and I prefered the scenes with the young Vito more than the scenes during present time.Is this the greatest sequel of all time? It sure possibly could be 
5496 i love how the scenes with yung vito look like they were filmed on aged cheese, but everything else about this kinda bored me (sorry not sorry). 
5497  Holy cow.Even though I hadn't seen it since I was about fourteen, I used to think anyone who thought Part II was better than Part I was crazy. I rewatched it and now I might be one of them.I mean good lord. The structure. The performances. The complete deconstruction and lack of glamorization of the gangster genre, with significantly more complex characters than in the first film. The final few minutes are awe-inspiringly perfect and powerful, with the‚Ä¶  
5498 It's not Citizen Kane. 
5499  Jesus christ that was boring. Not only that, it was 3 hours and 20 minutes of nothing happening. Almost no film should ever be that long. Sheesh.As I've heard it, The Godfather: Part II is supposed to be better than the first--one of the few sequels that surpasses its predecessor. Well, for me, that is not the case. The first was definitely better; admittedly, that's partially down to the fact that it wasn't as long as this sequel. Length‚Ä¶  
5500  Still to this day as the only sequel to win the Oscar for best picture, The Godfather: Part II is as riveting, gripping, suspenseful, and frankly, perfect as Part I. Francis Ford Coppola along with co-writer Mario Puzo have written two of the best screenplays of all time, between this and GF1. Every little piece of the puzzle has a significant meaning, and the story is told in such a fascinating way that viewers are left in awe. Even the‚Ä¶

5503 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   "Your country ain't your blood, remember that."The desert of tyranny. A vast tapestry on power and familial disintegration that marches towards its doom with frightening certainty; it might not be as flawlessly shaped as the first film but Coppola's use of counterpoint gives the tragedy a whole other dimension. Pacino prowls into vampiric territory here and his ability to radiate paranoia is the film's engine, he's well matched in the flashbacks by a very driven De Niro who manages‚Ä¶   
5504 Still more love for part one but this sequel did a damn fine job! 
5505  Damn I fuck with this much more than the first film. (Which I really liked, but still.)I put this on really late last night and was a bit terrified by the runtime but this might just be the best paced film I‚Äôve ever seen cause the 202 minutes just flew by like nothing.It‚Äôs really just incredibly entertaining. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs that much going on underneath the surface of this film, but everything on screen is just so‚Ä¶  
5506 I can‚Äôt say I understand the actions of Fredo as the only thing I hate more than fishing is children. 
5507 sorry guys 
5508  The sequel/prequel to one of the greatest and most influential movies ever made yields nearly the exact same results- carried by two enormous performances from Al Pacino and Robert De Niro- who is without a doubt the only non-insulting choice possible to play the same character as Marlon Brando. It‚Äôs also almost eerie how well he nailed the voice Brando did!¬†I could go on and on about the production value, which is tremendous, but I once again just found‚Ä¶  
5509 How can this be a masterpiece if its background is fucking shit? Wow, this movie fascinated me, great Al Pacino, giant Robert De Niro, wonderful mafia movie, I don't know what to say, I still think that The Godfather Part I is shit because I haven't felt that strong criticism reflected and I think this is much more my style, thank you very much 
5510 Each rewatch brings about small details you didn‚Äôt notice before. For example, Hyman Roth looked terrible for turning 67. 
5511 I don‚Äôt know, I think Michael Corleone might be a horrible human being. 
5512 one of the greatest films of all time, the very best of coppola & cinema 
5513  haven‚Äôt seen this in 4 years & it was a close 5 star then but after having rewatched the first & loving it way more, i was really excited for this one. & boy did it deliver. this is one of the best movies ever made. Francis Ford Coppola had complete control over this from that interview i watched on it. the seamless transitions from past to present are perfect. both storylines are perfect. didn't write my review for this right when i‚Ä¶  
5514 goddamn, i was entertained the whole way. a 3 and a half hour movie shouldn't be this fun to watch, especially with my goldfish attention span. even better than the already great godfather 1 imo. such a good movie 
5515 only seen first half so far, passed out due to fever. Good so far tho üëç 
5516 It is so rare for a sequel of a great movie to outdo the original at every level like this does. A particularly major feat when considering that the first movie is literally The Godfather. The Godfather is a fantastic movie no doubt, but The Godfather Part II is genuinely one of the greatest movies of all time.

5519  The passing of the baton from father to son shows perfectly how the mafia is destined to spread and to be handed down from generation to generation even after the death of his (original) boss. It is a problem that must be torn out at the roots.Once again, Coppola shows us the villainy and monstrosity of these people who, in order to achieve their goal, are ready to get rid of even the people closest to them.If you‚Äôre‚Ä¶  
5520  En esta impecable y necesaria segunda parte de la entrega, nos sumergimos en mayor profundidad en los pensamientos y personalidad de Michael Corleone, adem√°s de entender cual fue el origen de su padre, Don Vito.Contemplo este √∫ltimo apartado como una de las pautas m√°s importantes y de m√°s valor que nos ofrece la pel√≠cula. Podemos observar cual es el origen de Vito, de donde procede su apellido, y sobre todo, lo que simboliza. Cada una de estas cosas forjaran‚Ä¶  
5521  I‚Äôve gotta admit that I‚Äôm slightly underwhelmed with this one. I was expecting to potentially like it even more than the predecessor but unfortunately the first is comfortably better in my view. That‚Äôs not to say that it still isn‚Äôt a very good film because it is, but when it‚Äôs one of the highest rated films of all time, you go in with massive expectations. I thought this sequel had more going on than the original but the story didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶  
5522  When watching this series for the first time, an immediate grasp for me was the coverage of the monopolization of identity. In the first film I felt there was a repeated notion of the "afterlife" in how images of growth and development surround the Corleone family. These aspects as seen in the growing children and the sudden murders that challenge the self-perception of stability coalesce with the death of Vito and the emergence of Michael. Through legacy comes a collective‚Ä¶

5527 I understand those who enjoy part one more, but I respect this movie infinitely more than part one. Absolutely devastating. So good. 
5528 Once again, Coppola doesn‚Äôt surprise me. He creates another masterpiece, but I feel that it‚Äôs weaker than Part One, although still very strong. It‚Äôll be a tough choice to see if it belongs in my top 10 or not.

Mais les films de gangster c‚Äôest vraiment pas ce qui me fait kiffer honn√™tement.Il y a une vrai justesse dans chaque plan, et le sc√©nario est vraiment super bien ficel√©. Le parall√®le entre la r√©ussite et l‚Äô√©mergence de la famille corleone du c√¥t√© de vito. Et les difficult√©s de michael c‚Äôest vraiment sympa. 
5534 A trinitarian tragedy across generations. It cuts me to the heart. The mass of hopeful immigrants. Young Vito staring at the Statue of Liberty. Brothers reunited. And finally the penitent man, lonely in his chair. Is there a better film? 
5535  I know I just watched this so of course I can‚Äôt think of anything else, but is this my favorite movie ending of all time? I mean, if I really sat down and thought about it, it‚Äôs probably not. But dear god does that last dinner table scene hit you like a ton of bricks.

5549  1200th MovieI watched The Godfather over two years ago. I wanted to watch Part II for a somewhat special occasion. I don't know if this is a hot take but I think Part 2 is far superior than the first one.

5555 Der Moment, in dem Vito als kleiner Junge nach New York einf√§hrt. Der Kuss auf der Silvesterparty. Kays Gest√§ndnis. Franks besiegeltes Schicksal. Michael, alleine am Tisch. Diese Liste k√∂nnte weitergehen, denn The Godfather: Part II reiht beeindruckende Zeitzeugnis-Sequenzen, pr√§gende Scheidepunkte sowie ikonische Dialogzeilen aneinander, grandios begleitet durch Musik und Produktionsdesign, und der gesamte Schluss ist so herzzerrei√üend, wie es seitdem nur zwei andere Mafia-Filme waren. 
5556 It's too long. There, I said it. But the prophecy was true and I'm blown away at how fantastic a sequel this is, a perfect continuation of an already practically flawless story. Everything past the intermission is mastery. Think I'm still in Part One Gang currently (nothing can top the baptism), but it's impressively close. Can't believe the same guy who pulled this off twice also made Apocalypse Now - though granted Satan did get his end of that bargain with Jack and Part III, or so I hear. 
5557 michael corleone, you are SUCH a cunt (semi-affectionate, semi-derogatory) 
5558 Simply one of the greatest sequels of all time. This is cinema at its finest the two stories past and present is done so masterful. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone has to be one of the coldest and most complex characters of all time. He‚Äôs got it and he‚Äôs willing to do anything means necessary to keep his family safe even if it will hurt him. The score and cinematography is beautiful as I was fully invested in every scene. 
5559 It‚Äôs fantastic, but it‚Äôs too long. Contrary to what I‚Äôve been told, everything did not need to be in there.¬†Unpopular opinion: the first one is better, only very slightly though.¬†Fredo deserves no sympathy.¬†Again why is it so long, loses it a half ¬†star. 
5560  Si a mi me preguntaran cu√°l de las dos partes de El Padrino es mejor, hace unos algunos d√≠as me habr√≠a decantado por la primera, pero tras volver a ver hoy "The Godfather: Part II" me he dado cuenta de que no pueden separarse, pues las dos alcanzan unas cotas de maestr√≠a en todos los aspectos casi nunca alcanzadas en el cine. Como tal, son historias aparentemente independientes una de otra, sin embargo, hay un nexo de uni√≥n que las‚Ä¶  
5561 The Godfather: flooredThe Godfather Part II: boredCompletely beyond my understanding why anyone thinks this movie is worthy of being compared to the first. Even I used to think that! And I literally can't figure out why!! It's good don't get me wrong, but the really great parts of this film are separated by 40+ minutes of profound, beautifully-shot boredom on either side, and Part 1 is three hours of pure heat. I'd happily watch the first film again tomorrow. This one I may never again. 
5562 This movie is so fucking boring. ¬†It‚Äôs just weird ‚ÄúItalian‚Äù men doing tasks. ¬†It like among us but at least the death in among us are entertaining. ¬†Never watch this hot garbage movie. ¬†If I could give this 0 stars I would.

5565 Y‚Äôknow, I can‚Äôt help but wish Francis said ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù, made this thing 4 hours long, and gave us 40 more minutes of young Vito. Michael‚Äôs portion of the story feels complete, but to me, Vito‚Äôs feels like it only hits the important beats of his life without letting us know him in the way we know Michael.Otherwise, this is pretty much flawless.

5579 Yes, I think The Godfather part II is better than the first.No, I‚Äôm not an idiot.¬†For me, part II in what is to some the best collection of consecutive films in existence simply offers so much more substance than the first. The cinematography was so much better and I actually saw myself looking back and taking in the streets of Italian dominated New York City neighborhoods or the streets of Cuba. 
5580 The Godfather Part ll is one of the best sequels ever made. It got everything from the first and improved upon it, but this time making it a truly heartwrenching story. Michael Corleone is also quite possibly the greatest protagonist of Film/Television as well, up there with the likes of Walter White. These two films demonstrate quite possibly the greatest character arc ever put to film as well. The Godfather Part ll is epic, beautiful, and emotional, but you already know that. It‚Äôs without a doubt one of my new favorite films of all time. 
5581 Coppola really laid the blueprint for great modern filmmaking with these films. It's a clinic on how to stage, block, shoot, pace, construct one scene after another, after another.And the final scene is so spot-on with how memories work it's astonishing. 
5582 Everytime I wonder if I really want to dedicate my life to a career that is so oversaturated with lifeless heartless slosh, I watch a film like this and remember why i started. 
5583  Finally saw this after years of kicking myself for having never seen it before. The first film is an incredible masterpiece of a film. While this film WAS good, I have to say that I was a bit bored during large portions of it, specifically to do with the first two hours of the present day timeline. The opening implements the same technique of having it be at a big party that introduces all the main characters and the conflicts‚Ä¶  
5584  i hate myself so much right now, for a simple reason. my first watch of this brilliant, beautiful and legendary film was made while i was tired and sleepy and the story is pretty hard to follow when you are in this type of condition. that doesn't mean that i didn't enjoy because, well, i did and my rating reflects that but a movie like this doesn't deserve something like this from me. i'm sorry, gods of film. by the‚Ä¶

The whole sequel/prequel idea is terrific and works perfectly, and De Niro gives an amazing performance."

O dom√≠nio que o Coppola tem pelos personagens, principalmente nessa segunda parte √© fenomenal.Poderia ser algo piegas e sem subst√¢ncia, tentando apenas surfar na onda do primeiro, mas ele potencializa e aumenta o antecessor.

5590 I really liked this movie, not quite as much as the first one, but that might change whenever I watch it again. I think Michael is one of my favorite fictional characters, but dang does he fall apart in this movie. The last about 20 min were so sad to watch but I loved every second of it. A fantastic continuation 
5591 Spent $130 on authentic Italian pasta with the gang for this (thanks Frali). Loved how they mirrored the actions of father and son and how choices echo through generations. The flashback at the end to the first film was the perfect touch to remind us of how drastically Michael changed out of instinct and survival and how he has lost everything that was important to him in the first place. The shit hitting the fan in the last ten minutes was a blast.

5597 One of the greatest films ever, but I still prefer the original‚Ä¶ I think that speaks volumes to the series 
5598 they didn't speak true italian, I didn't even hear one gorlami 
5599  When I first saw this I said that not every scene is essential and for the life of me I have no idea which scene I was talking about. This is stunning, at once an epic crime drama that spans 70 years and 5 cities across North America and an intimate, disturbing story about one man who goes from someone with no morals to someone with no humanity. All that is made more tragic because the story is ostensibly about‚Ä¶

5601  The Sequel : One of the best sequels ever to be made. It can be argued that it surpasses the original. The filmmaking here is top notch. Every scene is filled with groundbreaking staging and framing. The two stories being told are engrossing on their own. Combine all that with effortless acting by Al Pacino. Him just sitting on a couch staring gives you goosebumps. Robert Di Nero is terrific. It just makes me happy that he was a part‚Ä¶

5606  After rewatching The Godfather last night, I had to rewatch The Godfather: Part II. What a perfect film! The storytelling serves up both a prequel & sequel. In doing so, we learn the similarities & differences between Vito & Michael Corleone. The latter of which has such a chilling character arc. The final scene‚Äôs easily one of the best endings that I‚Äôve ever seen. Coppola‚Äôs Visual storytelling is especially fitting during said ending scene. Felt very emotional!

The whole film is great but that last hour is probably the best 60 minutes in a film i have EVER seen.Despite the massive runtime i wasn't bored once it all flows so well, De niro as a young vito worked PERFECTLY.Part 1 and 2 are even better than the hype suggested, i am not the same man i was two films ago... 
5619  Damn this movie is not overrated at all it‚Äôs truly cinema .The Godfather Part 2 stands as a cinematic masterpiece for several reasons. Francis Ford Coppola's direction is nothing short of brilliant, seamlessly weaving the complex narrative between Michael Corleone's present and Vito Corleone's past. The film's camera angles and cinematography capture the essence of each scene, enhancing the storytelling.Character analysis reveals deep, nuanced portrayals, especially Al Pacino's compelling performance as Michael Corleone and Robert De Niro's captivating portrayal‚Ä¶

5631 The ending of this film is so goddamn haunting, and the rest of it so stunningly realised. The lingering master shot where Michael walks in to sit in front of a completely resigned Fredo¬†is one of the best ever.

5633  Wir brauchen gar nicht dar√ºber diskutieren, dass auch Der Pate II, genau wie sein Vorg√§nger, ein sehr guter Film ist. Rein n√ºchtern betrachtet sogar ein nahezu perfekter. Coppolas Regie, die darstellerischen Leistungen von s√§mtlichen Beteiligten, die Ausstattung, der Score etc. Auch diesem Film kann man im Grunde nicht viel vorwerfen.

5634 Simplismente uma das melhores sequ√™ncias do cinema, perfeito. 
5635 Gotta say I honestly preferred the first one 
5636 I‚Äôve never loved this film nearly as much as the first one, and while I still prefer the first movie, this has grown on me so much. The young Vito scenes are probably one of my favourite parts to a film of all time. Also, how the hell did Al Pacino not win an Oscar for this role? Absolutely wild. 
5637 damn near brought me to tears keep forgetting how powerful those final 10 minutes are, the greatest story ever told no doubt 
5638 prob the only three and a half hour movie I could watch at home and stay completely locked in through the closing credits 
5639 Prefiro a parte 1 
5640 No sex scene 
5641  Second verse same as the first, Godfather 2 has many of the strengths that the first had, even excelling in some areas. The characters face much appreciated development, specifically 3: Vito, Michael, and the twist villain. The film hops around time and juggles the perspective of Vito and Micheal, giving us insight on how Vito came to be and the parallels between himself and Michael. Both are great characters, but I really like what they did with the twist "villain"‚Ä¶  
5642 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   ü§åü§å(In all seriousness, I think this deserves a little more than emoji's)The Godfather Part II is single the greatest sequel of all time and an improvement over the first film (no disrespect whatsoever).We find a much more mature and grounded take with Michael as the new head of the family, Fredo is given much more to do as a character and his death at the end strikes us in surprise, the parallel between Don Vito's story and‚Ä¶

If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill anybody.The Godfather might just be the most revered film of all time. Everything about the film is simply perfect, and it embodies something that can only be done in the medium of film, because‚Ä¶  
5647 I don‚Äôt give a fuck what anyone says. This is better than the first. Anyone who says otherwise is wrong. Come at me. 
5648 so I finally got around to watching The Godfather Part II and yeah idk about this, godfather part 1 is defiantly superior in almost every way, part II lacks direction and also felt overly long, however I did like all the flash back sequences and Al Pacino kills it in this roles and defiantly carried it for me, same goes for Robert Deniro who succeeds in playing a younger Vito Corleone, Maybe I need to rewatch this but for now I think this movie is ovverated8.3/10 for 4 stars 
5649  I'm honestly surprised how this essentially has the same rating as the first godfather. It's significantly less captivating and is nowhere near as electric. In the first movie, Every other scene felt iconic and the slow pace felt justified because of how efficient the story was at building characters. There was always something really engaging going on to hook you into this rich world.For part 2, they hook you initially with one brief mystery that is immediately revealed and‚Ä¶

5652  The way this movie both plays with its own intertextuality in it‚Äôs parallel story telling between Michael and Vito, and also the film preceding it, is truly masterful and over its (in my opinion) perfectly paced run time (something very hard to do with an epic like this) allows for yes a more understated conclusion than the first, but one no less dramatic, impactful or beautifully haunting than it‚Äôs predecessor.¬†Do I like this movie more than the first, I‚Ä¶  
5653 had to let it linger for a bit before deciding on a rating but omfg the writing and pacing is incredible truly tragic and engaging, so impressed by how sympathetic I am to Michael and the complexities presented in this film

5671  Epic and sublime. Amongst the greatest films ever. Such artistic ambition - and entirely successful. Both a prequel and a sequel - but enriches the original too.Destruction follows creation. A crime family born through a search for community justice. Violence used as a weapon to protect immigrant families from corruption and exploitation. And within one generation the Corleone family wrecked by the very concentration of power it acted against. Any sense of honour amongst thieves is rejected entirely. Michael's‚Ä¶

5674 The corrupting, degradative power America holds over even the most powerful family in the country, twisting family into business and forcing brotherhood into betrayal. I have very little to say about it, other than the experience of seeing the first on the big screen last year has made me all the more excited to do the same with this one.

5676 If all goes right, I will hold a degree in English literature in the next two months. I think what I‚Äôve learned through reading way, way too much classic American literature in my day is that there are truly zero books with a stake for the title of The Great American Novel that are not bleak and depressing as hell. Similarly, The Godfather, perhaps the Great American Film Series, reads to me as as close as you can get to writing a true tragedy in modern times. Devastating movie. 
5677 I gave this film 3 hours and 30 minutes of my life. I will never regret it 
5678 Unbelievable how this perfect sequel, a film in the conversation for best of all time was kinda reluctantly directed by Coppola. That scene with Tom and Frankie outside with their cigars is incredible. It's also crazy how Frankie's character was subbed into the film last-minute.The music (and obviously this film) is just so tragic. There's elements of that in the first film but goddamn does it write home this time round :/ 
5679 You know a film is epic when you have 3 days off and you clear a days schedule just to watch The Godfather Part 2.¬†No great revelation that it‚Äôs better than the first. Coppola puts Michael Corleone (by far the most compelling character) front and centre and it‚Äôs equally cruel and ruthless. This is a world you can lose yourself in, so much nuance on screen. Forgot Harry Dean Stanton was in this.¬†I have an undying respect for Francis Ford Coppola and here‚Äôs hoping Megalopolis is worth the decades of anticipation he‚Äôs been priming us for. 
5680 Me tarde mucho en verla , la vi unas 3 veces y no me arrepiento de nada de lod mejores films q vi 
5681 Not as good as the first but still pretty goddamn phenomenal in pretty much every way. Found the Michael plot to be a bit more interesting and suspenseful than the Vito storyline, but De Niro kills it in his portions of the movie. Almost a 5. 
5682 one of the rare sequels to surpass the original

5684 i feel like a psych ward patient walking down the halls every time i watch this 
5685 üü©üü©97üü©üü©I never thought a sequel could outshine the original so much, and I just how well-put together this movie was. Pacino delivers a compelling performance that showcases the character's transition from an innocent and romantic youth to a ruthless and cunning boss. The last scene with Pacino is one of the most impactful scenes in the movie and leaves a lasting impression on the audience. It's a rare sequel that outshines its predecessor, thanks to its brilliant storytelling, exceptional acting, and masterful direction. 
5686 I think I should take more of a break before watching the third one. A guy pushed past me, when getting off the train, earlier today and the first thought that popped into my head was that I should kill him to set an example for the rest of the passengers. 
5687 I liked the first one more honestly 
5688  Man I hate to be predictable, but this picture is simply perfection incarnated. The second chapter in the Godfather trilogy is the playbook example on how to do a sequel right. It expands on the history of the Corleone family telling us Vito's rise to power, and giving us more info on his morals, values and how they came to be, thus retroactively making the first film even better (I thought it wasn't possible, but here we are). This film‚Ä¶

5693  "I know it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart. You broke my heart."'The Godfather part. II' is even a richer work than its successful predecessor; the major acting, Coppola's direction and stylish cinematography create a convincing epic quality for this film, that perfectly serves as both a sequel and a prequel.It's fascinating not just to watch a movie, but also being able to watch a study on a migrant community and the power within it, while witnessing‚Ä¶  
5694 90/100Still a great film but not on the same level as the first imo. This one banks on what was already previously established in the first film. I like how this focuses on the character of Michael and Don Vito. You can definitely feel the run time and it‚Äôs sometimes hard to keep up with what all is happening. Still an impressive film with a great structure and dialogue and a great continuation of the character Michael Corlione but too long and doesn‚Äôt feel like it has the same stakes as the first one. 
5695 had some trouble keeping up with all the names, but it went much better than pt 1 
5696 any mob boss born in the 1920s can‚Äôt cook‚Ä¶ all they know is olive oil business front, kiss they brother, murder, be a paranoid girlloser , eat hot chip & lie 
5697 My goal is to love this movie as much as I love its predecessor. I will start by figuring out what is going on in Michael‚Äôs storyline 
5698 One of the greatest films of all time. I loved the first, but the second is just, so flawless. I love how the story transitions from part one. Pacino is fantastic but all the flashback Deniro scenes are the best out of the whole series. While the first is known to be more iconic, this one being slower and patient just gives everything a much more grounded and poignant lift. The editing, the music, direction, cinematography, performances. Just wow. What a film. 
5699 What‚Äôs more crushing to watch, Al Pacino losing his soul or the move from NYC to NevadaReally good obviously but what a bummer movie!Update: have been compelled in 5 recent conversations to say ‚Äúthis is just like the godfather,‚Äù when all you have is a hammer everything looks like a nail I guess

5702  I feel safe in sticking to my belief that the first movie is better after revisiting both back to back. I appreciate the broader scope of this one and that it's almost entirely a tale of Michael's descent to darkness, but the first movie did a perfect job of showing how quickly he went down that path. And I never felt that I needed to see Vito's backstory, because his portrayal in the first movie immediately tells you everything you‚Ä¶

5706 Put the pitchforks down! I can‚Äôt, in good conscience, give a sequel higher marks than the original (in this case at least). It‚Äôs too long‚Äî and I just watched and enjoyed the hell out of Brighter Summer Day. It‚Äôs really just that there are too many subplots happening at the same time for this story.¬†It‚Äôs still good, but not at all a perfect film. 
5707 Upon rewatch, I realized how damn gut-wrenching this film really is (especially in those last 30 minutes), Coppola is excellent at showing strong emotions in an interesting way, and while this film isn't as good as the first, it certainly lives up to it.

5709 While The Godfather¬†and The Godfather: Part 2¬†essentially work together as one film, I must admit the sequel (and prequel) really blew me away this rewatch, even more so than the original.¬†2nd viewing¬† 
5710  La segunda parte de El Padrino nos entrega dos l√≠neas temporales: una en el presente, con Michael Corleone lidiando con un traidor dentro de su grupo y con enemigos cercanos que desean liquidarlo; y otra en el pasado, con la vida de Vito Corleone, c√≥mo pas√≥ de ser un ni√±o inmigrante al gran jefe de familia que conocimos en la obra original.Ya hab√≠a visto esta pel√≠cula en m√°s de una ocasi√≥n, pero hac√≠a a√±os que no la revisitaba, por‚Ä¶  
5711 This is a longer and even richer continuation of the first 'Godfather' film and a quiet compelling character piece of the father and son. At once and prequel and sequel, the events of each one's journey to lead this crime family run parallel in story telling format. BIt has a terrific end, BTW.üíØ100%A+AwesometacularBetter Than Sex 
5712  99/100 overall.¬†How can a sequel be at the same level of its predecessor when its predecessor is ‚ÄòThe Godfather‚Äô?‚ÄòPart II‚Äô is perfect in every aspect, not a single negative or a nitpick can be spotted throughout the film. It‚Äôs very ambitious in scope, since it serves as a prequel and a sequel to the original, and it executes that perfectly, with both stories following Vito and Michael heavily differs yet still similar. The runtime is 202 mins, yet‚Ä¶  
5713 two years to the day since i first watched 
5714 Not as good as the first one ngl. But hey, we still get to see Vito Corleone's backstory, and a very solid continuation of the story. So I'm fine with that. I just wished it was as powerful as the first one, and it wasn't...

5717  A perfect sequel in every imaginable way.The Godfather Part II is immaculate and grand, mirroring its predecessor in terms of narrative identity and visual visage. The biggest difference, however, is the way in which this film approaches its narrative. After all, it‚Äôs a great tragedy, depicting Michael Corleone‚Äôs downward spiral as he tosses aside the true values of family and respect established by his father in favor of the dangerous expansion of his wealth and influence. Everything I could‚Ä¶  
5718 Slightly better than part 1 imo 
5719  "Times are changing."It's very obvious that time is the essence of this part, the pacing of the movie explains it all, it's slow, then fast, then slow again. Brilliant montages are employed, the movie beautifully depicts the change by both the timeline it focuses on, we witness the creation of a world and we witness the same break down as a new system takes over. The future is swallowed by the present and the present by the past, thereby‚Ä¶

5721 call me michael corleone the way fredo has broken my heart ... :( 
5722  I prefer the first just by a smidge but Part II is no doubt one of the greatest films ever made.¬†Some of the greatest acting performances I‚Äôve ever seen all in one film. Pacino and DeNiro in particular give some of their best ever.The cinematography is obviously incredible, the score is fantastic, the pacing is unbelievably good despite the film being 3¬Ω hours long, and the ending is one of the best in cinematic history.The only thing‚Ä¶  
5723 What a way to spend a long plane flight! It was fun being able to change the brightness since I normally have not done this feature at home.¬†Anyways, a perfect film. I already told you this last month.¬†Now, I am in Vegas for a few days. 
5724 Extremely generic and cold take but possibly the greatest movie ever made. Not sure if it's my favorite but obviously a masterpiece 
5725 This was sooo boring, I'd rather watch The Flintstones (1994) 
5726 Michael Corleone is one brutal, merciless motherfucker. And he doesn't even pull a trigger in this film. Holy Shit. 
5727 isn‚Äôt quite as perfectly tight as the first one, but breaks my heart so thoroughly and god, the don vito segments just SING. 
5728 Which is better, The Godfather or¬†The Godfather Part II? Well, why don‚Äôt you just ask for the formula for cold fusion while you are at it! 
5729 A beautiful, haunting tragedy about how business is a soul sucking nightmare if not handled correctly and empathetically. Also, a bunch of people get killed and it‚Äôs really fun to watch.The slowest slow-burn in all of cinema. Maybe too slow? I do wonder if the length was an issue, because this was the first time I‚Äôve nearly fallen asleep while watching a movie, but that‚Äôs probably because of my old age.Pacino is terrifying and De Niro is unintentionally hilarious. What more could you ask for?‚Ä¶the first one is better. 
5730 now, do I watch 3 or no? 
5731  The epic continuation of the Corleone family sees a young Vito Corleone fleeing Sicily after the killing of his parents and his arrival to Ellis Island and his rise to power on the streets of New York. ¬†While decades later Michael Corleone tightens his grip on the organized crime syndicate. ¬†At ¬†three hours plus this is commitment to get though as it could easily have been made into two separate movies. ¬†But you always feel like you‚Äôre watching something special.‚Ä¶

I didn‚Äôt always follow the specifics of what was happening in their business language. I like the first two, but I did feel underwhelmed a tiny bit.¬†Again lots of positives, but it‚Äôs mostly plot so spoilers.I will hopefully not take over a year to watch the next one 
5735  A fantastic sequel, one of the greats!¬†I know some prefer this over the first but I gotta say some bits in this really didn‚Äôt work for me. Such as Vito‚Äôs storyline, now I understand why it‚Äôs in there, to make what Michael is doing harder to watch as he destroys what his father took his entire life to build after losing it all. But it just never really grabbed me, I wasn‚Äôt as into it as the rest of‚Ä¶

5747  Fantastic, clever, and overflowing with talent, this movie reminds the viewer why they loved The Godfather, although it is not better than it¬†(but that begs the question: could anything be?) That being said, both parts work like the Kill Bill volumes in that the story they each tell work together to enrich each. There is nothing it attempts to do that it doesn‚Äôt soar at, and there is enough material between the two parts for a lifetime of lessons about‚Ä¶  
5748 not as good as the original imo, but i can see its qualities.the vito corleone‚Äôs origin arch with the amazing robert de niro was way better and more interesting than michael‚Äôs downfall (which i loved to see). 
5749  English part belowIm Gegensatz zu Teil 1 zieht mich Part 2 einfach nicht so in den Bann. Die komplette erste Stunde langweilt mich regelrecht und ich verstehe nicht so richtig warum man die Prequelsequenzen braucht.Als man dann in Havanna zieht es endlich etwas an, aber an das perfekte Konstrukt welches mir bekannt war hatte das nichts mehr zu tun. Am Ende ist er mir dann zu sprunghaft.So bleibt ein handwerklich meisterhaftes Epos, welches mich inhaltlich jedoch einfach‚Ä¶  
5750  Oh, so that's why everybody says that this is the greatest movie ever made. I can buy into that now.This is the perfect kind of sequel, one that reinforces the themes of the first movie at such a high level that it retroactively makes an already-great film even better. The Godfather Part II builds perfectly on the generational conflict within the Corleone Family, as Michael grows to become the living antonym of his father's legacy. Getting a glimpse at‚Ä¶  
5751  I always stuck to my guns that The Godfather¬†was better than Part II, but¬†after rewatching again now I have to finally admit defeat. ¬†Michael‚Äôs powerfully tragic fall from youthful idealist into a paranoid, bitter recluse paralleled with his father‚Äôs rise to power while still remaining an honourable man is just too good, and watching Vito‚Äôs dreams for a better life for his family come to nothing in the end is so bleak. ¬†Pacino and De Niro are great, along with‚Ä¶  
5752 People complain about long movies these days but really the problem is everyone forgot the part where you have to make them good. This is almost three-and-a-half hours and I wouldn't cut a minute. 
5753 Really good but was expecting a ten oh wellStill really good though and I‚Äôm kinda in aw that this film exists like how many big kino films have sequels especially these days and let alone them be good the editing and al Pacino are obviously the standouts but everything is really good overall if it had a better colour pallet it would be a ten 
5754  If the tragedy of  The Godfather  was the loss of favorite son Michael's soul, who was once seen as the last best hope for a legitimate future, then the tragedy of its sequel is for the entire Corleone enterprise, for the actual familial unit that shares its name with the criminal empire. The first film showed us how there was no demarcation between the Corleone family - Vito and his wife and sons and daughters - and the criminal organization‚Ä¶  
5755 Are we all going to sit here and pretend that Michael didn‚Äôt eat that orange like a complete psycho? I don‚Äôt know why I never noticed that before. 
5756 i judge al pacino movies based on how much they make my pussy throb. 5 stars straight away 
5757  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel I have to wipe out everyone, just my enemies.‚Äùa Mecca of pure brilliance by the hand of legend Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather part II is everlasting proof that the sequel can outdo the original with performances from massive names like DeNiro and Pacino - carrying a three hour film like it‚Äôs nothing. It finds a way to do a lot of what‚Äôs in the original without feeling repetitive yet building on top of that at‚Ä¶  
5758 gorgeous dad gorgeous son 
5759 No wonder teenage me didn't like this. Like its predecessor, this film doesn't put the pieces together for you. And unlike something like, say, Fury Road, it didn't have the bombast to keep my attention. Of course, I now see the error of my ways. Anyways this film owns. 9/10 with an 10/10 ending. 
5760 Incredible, but not quite The Godfather.¬†The stuff with Michael was just so much more entertaining but I do understand the importance of the Vito comparison. 
5761 The Godfather: Here We Go Again.Why did no one tell me about young Robert De Niro in this? Mamma mia. Wanted more young Vito for sure. 
5762 Another perfect Godfather movie. There are less iconic scenes in this one than in the first one but the scenes are perfect nonetheless. Robert DeNiro is amazing as a young Vito and it is great to learn more about Vito's young years. 
5763  I am once again fucking up my sleep schedule with an exam due in less than one day to watch The Godfather üî®üî®‚ÄºÔ∏è¬†Time well spent, fuck it, a good all nighter never hurt anyone !!¬†Love this film, as many do, for the Bobby we get to see, impeccable and totally enthralling anytime he is on screen. Although, Pacino and the ‚Äòcurrent‚Äô¬†events we see are still interesting but there is a new side and story we are seeing so‚Ä¶  
5764 First time watching this with the knowledge of Al Pacino‚Äôs Shrek phone case. Total game changer. 
5765  I feel like I prefer The Godfather more than it‚Äôs sequel Part 2. It‚Äôs not that it‚Äôs even missing anything, in fact Coppola creates another masterpiece, a second part to a fascinating dynamic of Americanism powered centred around a family. Although missing Brando Al Pacino again has a stunning performance, so much emotion in the face and eyes as evil corrupts, pieces fall. I found De Niro‚Äôs story a little lacking at first but it truly hits its places in‚Ä¶  
5766  The Godfather: Part II is similar to its predecessor but takes some calculated risks that are very interesting and make this film just fly by even with its long runtime. Here, we still see 2 stories: Michael's and Vito's, thought this time Vito's are scenes from the past. And it's this constant comparison of the now and then that makes The Godfather: Part II so good. On one hand, we see Vito being a 'family man' and we cut to‚Ä¶

5769  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel I have to wipe everyone out, Tom. Just my enemies, that‚Äôs all.‚Äù - Michael CorleoneIt‚Äôs stands with its predecessor as a phenomenal movie.The performances are still unbelievably amazing. Al Pancio is just perfect. You can feel the pressure building in him when he argues with Kay. In that fight, you see both of their points. Really, it‚Äôs incredible. Robert DeNiro is fantastic as young Vito. And once again, everyone was so interesting, I made it‚Ä¶  
5770  I see 'The Godfather' as two parts. Without one the other tells only half a story; and it makes sense because not only both films were based on the novel of the same name by Mario Puzo, but they are known as one of the greatest films of all time. As much as I love the first part, the second is slightly better. While Part I has a more consistent pace, Part II double downs on what works before. The‚Ä¶  
5771  ‚ÄúThe Godfather 2‚Äù follows on from the first film ‚Äú The Godfather‚Äù with a sequel set in two distinct eras. As Michael ( Al Pacino ) takes control of the family and family business interests in the 1940‚Äôs and 1950‚Äôs, ¬†his father, Vito ( Robert De Niro ) a young Sicilian immigrant is trying to establish himself in the land of opportunity during the early 1900‚Äôs. What ensues is a¬†Francis Ford Coppola masterpiece that is both a prequel and sequel‚Ä¶  
5772  I was afraid of this because I didn't love the first part and this one is even longer, but I was also looking forward to it because I knew it was not only a sequel but also a prequel at the same time that tells Vito Corleone's backstory in flashbacks, and those parts were so good that I actually liked it better. The sequel parts were way too long and just as relatively uninteresting to me as I expected, but‚Ä¶  
5773 Three and a half hours, didn‚Äôt get up from my seat once. Perhaps the greatest sequel/prequel of all time, carries over all that worked about the original while adding its own plot and identity. So many powerful moments that are immortalised in cinema history. The Godfather films are such profound works of art, perhaps cinema‚Äôs greatest achievement in the same way The Sopranos is American television‚Äôs greatest achievement. Both works analyse what it means to live in America through wholly unique emotional experiences, family being a key part of the puzzle as well as crime. May their legacy live on. 
5774 The best movie of all time. If there were a way to give it 6 stars I would. 
5775 "I know it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart." - me after an undercooked fettuccine alfredo dinner upsets my stomach 
5776 Finally got to watch this movie. It's shocking how well paced it is being over three hours long. One thing that stood out as I watched this was how good the family dynamic is. It‚Äôs not really a crime movie, it's a family drama. It‚Äôs very sad and moving in that way. 
5777 Upon first viewing The Godfather 1 and 2, I recall preferring the first to the second but now that I‚Äôve rewatched both in cinema, I prefer part 2 a lot more. Everything that felt a little off in part 1 feels complete here, and I felt even more invested this time around, taking in the emotional blows that are portrayed.¬†There‚Äôs a reason these films are considered classics - they‚Äôre the epitome of cinematic class and brilliance that have managed had such a big cultural impact too.Hope you‚Äôre all doing well! :) 
5778 The godfather 2 is, in many ways, a sequel to the godfather 
5779 Perfect 
5780 Best. Night. Ever 
5781 Yeah, I'm team "Part 1" 
5782 It‚Äôs so hard to find a good assassin these days (for legal reasons this is a joke) 
5783 ‚ÄúKeep your friends close, but your enemies closer.‚ÄùThis film is pure art. I absolutely loved it, the acting was so good as well. 
5784 I liked the first one more but this one was actually really good, too. I also think this is now one of the longest films I‚Äôve ever watched, if not the longest, but it being so long certainly didn‚Äôt get in the way. Honestly, this movie is great and it is filled with stunning performances from the whole cast. 
5785  Francis Ford Coppola(english/deutsch)In the continuing saga of the Corleone crime family, a young Vito Corleone grows up in Sicily and in 1910s New York. In the 1950s, Michael Corleone attempts to expand the family business into Las Vegas, Hollywood and Cuba. Drawing on strong performances by Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, Francis Ford Coppola's continuation of Mario Puzo's Mafia saga set new standards for sequels that have yet to be matched or broken.Der Pate II ist‚Ä¶  
5786 2nd best film of ALL TIME after The Godfather 1

5788 It's good to see other low budget, up and coming directors take inspiration from Paul Blart: Mall Cop but i would like to see more creative input as i felt it's too similar to Zookeeper or more accurately, Grown Ups 2. Love the homemade vibe tho. 
5789 A great divorce, prequel, AND Lake Tahoe movie! 
5790 Finishing 2021 right 
5791  Like i said in Yesterday's Review of The Godfather (1972). Considered by Historians and Critics as One of the Best films Ever Made, so Good that it Became the Highest Grossing Film in 1972, With Tons of Oscar Nominations and Winners. It was Obviously that a Sequel was Coming so then it Came about in 1974 As "The Godfather Part 2". So Is The Godfather Part 2 One of Those Sequels That are Better Than the Original? Many people up‚Ä¶  
5792  Origin stories have drowned out the originality of the big-budget feature. Nowadays, everything, whether it is a supporting riff from an old legend or a leading role of an established franchise, needs an origin story. Before it was hip and resourceful to do so, though, The Godfather II¬†took a portion of the Mario Puzo book,¬†The Godfather, and siphoned it off into a sequel. While it may open with a mother‚Äôs love for her young boy and the¬†lengths¬†she will go to‚Ä¶  
5793 This is the exception to the rule that all sequels are bad. This movie is just flawless 
5794 Lesson learned: don‚Äôt trust your memory of when you saw this as a late teenager.¬†4.5? What the hell, Chris‚Ä¶The parallel stories of Vito developing his empire through building a family with Michael maintaining the empire while destroying his family is nothing short of genius.And Al Pacino‚Ä¶ considering how ‚ÄúPacino‚Äù he could be later in his career, his restraint shown here is just remarkable. A brilliant performance - and DeNiro, Cavale, Gazzo, Keaton, and the rest rise to the occasion, too.I think I prefer G1, but The Godfather Part II is yet another American masterpiece of the 1970s.Rating increase (duh): 4.5 ‚Äî> 5 
5795  The older I get, the more I have grown to dislike Michael Corleone. We witnessed his fall from grace in Part 1 and part 2 is all about the repercussions and the cost of maintaining power as an Italian mobster in America. Running parallel to Michael's decent into the Underworld, we witness his father, Vito Corleone, in his youth back in Italy and discover the origins of The Godfather's criminal organization. I really enjoy the Vito sequences, Robert De Niro‚Ä¶  
5796 michael corleones worst act was biting into an orange with the skin on 
5797 al pacino could play mario but chris pratt couldn‚Äôt play michael corleone 
5798 I don‚Äôt know what shit I was on when I rated this 3 1/2 
5799 the fact that there was a literal intermission half way through this film shows that it was way too long 
5800 I love part one but this is just better in nearly every way 
5801 The rare sequel that imo is every bit as good as the first.Absolutely recommend. 
5802 Double featured this and part one today. It's amazing the adrenaline rush that part one gives you, the thrill of realizing the extent of Michael's fall, the physical shutting out of his family foreshadowing its fracture. Part two on the other hand is completely deflating. On this watch, I noticed even more the amount of time Michael spends alone as the film progresses. He starts surrounded by people, brightly lit, the very image of power and influence. By the end, he is all alone, in the dark, and hunched over, defeated. 
5803  Die Perfekte Fortsetzung des Original Klassikers von Francis Ford Coppala. Da sie zum einen nicht nur die Geschichte vom neuen Don Micheal fortf√ºhrt, sondern die Backstory von Don Vito beleuchtet. Somit haben wir nicht nur ein reines Sequel sondern ein Sequel/Prequel. Vito Corleone wird diesen mal von Robert De Niro gespielt und das auch sehr gut. Er ist zwar einer meiner Lieblingsschauspieler, trotzdem kommt er nicht an Marlon Brando ran. Al Pacino spielt hier Performance seines Lebens. Wer meine Reviews‚Ä¶  
5804 "ÿ•ÿ¨ÿπŸÑ ÿ£ÿµÿØŸÇÿßÿ°ŸÉ ŸÇÿ±Ÿäÿ®ŸäŸÜ ŸÖŸÜŸÉÿå ŸÑŸÉŸÜ ÿ£ÿ¨ÿπŸÑ ÿ£ÿπÿØÿßÿ°ŸÉ ŸÇÿ±Ÿäÿ®ŸäŸÜ ÿ£ŸÉÿ´ÿ±." 
5805 Francis you son of a bitch 
5806 I cannot express how happy I am that I love this. I never thought in a million years that I‚Äôd prefer this to the first but this might actually be the case. 
5807 There are very few movies ever that give you chills on every rewatch and make you feel the same emotions you felt the first time you experienced the movie. This is one of them. The way Michael's plummet into darkness and vengeance is paralleled with his father's ascension into power is so masterful that it‚Äôs hard to comprehend such an achievement. It never gets old. The performances never get old. Pacino yelling loud as fuck out of nowhere never gets old. 
5808 I thought it was much better than the first! But maybe my taste has changed? I want to rewatch part 1 now, but knowing me, I‚Äôll never get around to a 3 hr rewatch in this lifetime 
5809 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   A worthy sequel to an all-time classic, The Godfather Part II is a detailed study into the contrast between the virtues and values of Vito Corleone and the flaws and failings of Michael Corleone.The direct references to the first film, in both the opening scenes of the Don taking visitors at a family function and the closing scenes of loose ends being tied up by way of intimidation and murder, was a simple but effective touch. Is Coppola trying‚Ä¶   
5810 i think i do like the first one a bit more than this one but this is an amazing sequel like holy shit, everything about it is great, both al pacino and robert de niro‚Äôs performances are so good and just the writing and story to this is amazing¬†such a powerful film, perfect classic 
5811  I've always maintained that while The Godfather is an unimpeachable masterpiece and the most re-watchable of the trilogy, The Godfather: Part II is the better film. In an attempt to reconcile those two almost contradictory statements, we sat down and watched the longest and most complex of the trilogy today.Incorporating elements of Mario Puzo's original novel that were left out of the first film, primarily the backstory of Vito coming to America, it presents its second great quasi-contradiction: it's‚Ä¶  
5812 not terrible 
5813  Month of Sinister SequelsMore than a film this is a step by step playbook on acting!¬†I have been watching this 3 and a half hour mafia epic since I was a kid, and just like Hyman Roth‚Äôs cake, this film is as tantalising as ever.¬†Secondary to Al Pacino is John Cazale who bares his heart and soul in one of the best scenes of delivered dialogue on screen.¬†The calculated lord of capital and death that Michael Corleone has‚Ä¶  
5814  man this is the best movie ever made.¬†this time I really noticed how Michael only loses his composure twice in the entire film, and in the two most pivotal scenes. I think it really shows how those two moments deeply affect him.¬†also, from the Cuba scene to the end of the movie, it is genuinely impossible to look away. It is a lot slower than the part I at first, but I think the film makes it feel‚Ä¶  
5815 Not as same level as the first one. But still magnificent. 
5816 I expected nothing less from the sequel. 
5817 I‚Äôm going to keep it short‚Ä¶- Cinematic masterpiece- do I think it‚Äôs better than the first one? No I don‚Äôt- it is close though, since Daddy De Niro is in¬†this one- obviously a fucking classic and an amazing movie 
5818 Easily one of the best sequels of all time. Everything is so damn good in it and there is no quality drop off from the first. 
5819 Wow, I am speechlessJust like Part 1, I feel like it doesn't matter what I say about this film, because chances are, it has been saidMaybe I need to rewatch it before I make a final opinion 
5820 Finally I watched this film.. Its great I enjoyed every second de niro is on the screen everyone else idk.last hour of the film is straight up boring and not interesting only moment I was glued was de niro's part.I didnt like the pacing in the first one, this one was a bit better but still ......good movie bye.

5835 YALL DONT UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH THIS MOVIE MEANS TO ME 
5836 This movie goes on for so long that I was able to bite all my finger nails off and have them re-grow before the movie ended(BTW I prefer part 1, Sorry not Sorry) 
5837  To my mind, this is one of those rare sequels that not only manages to outdo the original, but it manages to retroactively make the original better.I know this movie has been talked about to death by literally everyone and their mother at this point, but if there's one thing that made this film stand apart from the original it was it's use of juxtaposition between Vito's upbringing and Michael's downfall. These narratives run completely parallel to one another‚Ä¶  
5838 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  the academy managed to rob al pacino here more than the characters in ocean‚Äôs 13, smhabsolutely masterpiece, almost as good as the first one, the difference is that here didn‚Äôt had the og godfather, brando.pov: both john cazale and michael v.gazzo putted a better performance than de niro (he was still great tho) in this ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

5842 Really, really really brilliant. All the greatest things you can say about a film, this one deserves. The first one is much more fun - this one made me more profoundly sad tonight while watching than it ever had before - but Part II is certainly the more astounding piece of work.‚ÄúKeep your friends close, but your enemies closer.‚ÄùMesmerizing. Makes 3.5 hours pass like 25 minutes. It‚Äôs all about what you do out of hate, versus what you do out of love. Simply great. 
5843 i want to party in tahoe with my family so fucking bad 
5844 I wish I could give this one more star than the five stars I gave the first Godfather movie which is near perfect. This one is more perfecter. Fucking Fredo! 
5845 perhaps this is unpopular but i preferred part I to part II, don‚Äôt have much to say everything has already been said about these films we know.except the italian SUCKS even more this time they really said ‚Äúwe are going to do whole conversationsü§™‚Äù but had no idea of what italian sounded like, kinda offended??? 
5846 "Fuck you my child is completely fine" your child literally watch The Godfather Part II for the tenth time instead of going to therapy 
5847  If you want further proof that The Godfather: Part II is a long movie, it is the only entry in the trilogy to have two discs in my DVD boxset collection. It's an event, and a lot is going on as it splits between the past and present between the rise of Vito Corleone after arriving in America as an immigrant, as well as Michael living up and honoring his father's legacy.The back-and-forth, non-linear narrative actually works here, as‚Ä¶  
5848 Better than the original? In my middle age I'm coming around to believing it just may be. To think that Coppola made this and The Conversation in the same year. Fucking hell. 
5849  Ce que j‚Äôaime bcp au del√† du fait que c‚Äôest un chef d‚Äô≈ìuvre c‚Äôest cette ironie tragique que d√©gage le film. Le fait de voir Michael devenir de plus en plus puissant mais paradoxalement perdre peu a peu tous ses proches pour s‚Äôenfoncer dans la solitude la plus totale, y‚Äôa quelque chose d‚Äôassez sarcastique. L‚Äôun des hommes les plus puissants d‚ÄôAmerique n‚Äôarrive m√™me pas √† contr√¥ler sa propre famille. L‚Äôexemple le plus marquant de cette absence de contr√¥le c‚Äôest lorsque‚Ä¶  
5850 The dog stays.Anyway, I think everyone should read Eve Babitz‚Äôs essay on the making of this. One of the most fun movie journalism pieces I‚Äôve ever read. 
5851 What an amazing film! I think I might have enjoyed this even more than the first one, that might be because I was already into the story though!Al Pacino gives an absolutely mesmerising performance, it‚Äôs definitely up there with the best performances ever.And that scene with Fredo on the boat was incredibly sad. Robert De Niro was really good too, I was surprised all of his stuff was in Italian but he was still amazing!Not sure whether to be excited for part 3 or not, I‚Äôll have to wait and see! 
5852 How do you make olive oil. That's my Godfather Pt. II. Where are the olives keeping their oil and why does olive oil taste good but olives taste bad. Robert De Niro olive oil movie when 
5853 The Corleones, Part IIA more extended and elaborate feature but it's as great as the first movie, at the end both are cut from the same story and concept but in fact seeing this Part II as prequel and sequel gives a lot more sense and impact to the Corleone saga. I love it! 
5854 Definitely enjoyed this more than the first Godfather. A runtime of more than 3 hours but it flew by thanks to it's great pacing. Al Pacino was A+ in this sequel but I really wanted to see more of De Niro, he was brilliant in the short time he had on screen and I wish he even had his own prequel film.

5859  From the opening seconds you know something is different. This is no ordinary "great" movie but really a once in a lifetime sort of masterpiece.Watching idealism descend into capitalism before your very eyes. The contrasting lives of a man who conquers the world for his family, and his son who trades his family for the world. Family isn't an abstract idea, it's the people around us. It's literal, tangible. It's made so much more rich by Coppola's strong connection‚Ä¶

This is most definitely a rhetorical question, and there is no way that I could possibly answer it. When you love a movie, you just feel it in your bones. You could rewatch it immediately. You become completely absorbed by the movie, and nothing can interrupt you. But you don‚Äôt necessarily know exactly why‚Ä¶That is why it has always felt so daunting to write about my two favorite movies of‚Ä¶   
5861 Did you go to college to get stupid? You're really stupid 
5862  Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.The Godfather Part II √© uma das continua√ß√µes mais celebradas da hist√≥ria do cinema, tendo muitos f√£s que consideram inclusive melhor que o filme original.Tudo que o primeiro filme tinha de bom esse tamb√©m tem. A fotografia de Gordon Willis continua muito bela e parece bem mais pesada que no filme original, a trilha sonora do Nino Rota continua excelente (detalhe que n√£o comentei na primeira review, n√£o me perdoei at√©‚Ä¶  
5863 Yeah, I mean it's great. A technical marvel. Gordon Willis and Walter Murch do revolutionary work. Murch changed sound mixing forever during his collaborations with Coppola.Great acting and writing. At once restrained and subtle, yet epic in scope. I really loved the De Niro flashbacks. Definitely the highlight of the film for me and poignant parallels to the present day storyline of Michael. And rarely bored me during its insane 200-minute runtime. 
5864 The family is more fragile than before 
5865 I just really don‚Äôt think Part II is better than the original, even though it‚Äôs still a pretty stunning achievement. But even though I have my issues with it and I‚Äôd be fine if it was never made, the entire thing is worth it for¬†1) John Cazale‚Äôs delivery of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm SMAHT!‚Äù2) Don Ciccio getting stabbed upThose two moments are worth the other 200 some odd minutes 
5866  I can say that I did prefer Part 1 over this, but it's undeniable that this is nonetheless a brilliant film. Especially the last hour, which I think really hits you hard emotionally. The film is powerful, but lacks something I can't put my finger on which the first film had. Perhaps it's the lack of Marlon Brando's Vito Corleone, but then again I did really enjoy watching Robert De Niro's portrayal of a young Vito Corleone, which made for‚Ä¶

5868 sexiest film ever 
5869  Naturally, by its own right The Godfather Part II is well-deserving of its place amongst cinemas all-time greatest.¬†As a sequel, it's even more impressive in that Coppola was able to recapture the exact aesthetic of its predecessor, visually and tonally, without succumbing to the pressures of trying to go bigger, and better. Sure certain characters have evolved, but accordingly so.¬†Although narratively this instalment lacks the depth of the first film, there's far more substance. The pacing‚Äôs faster and‚Ä¶

5871 My sister said Robert De Niro looks like Spiderus from Miss Spiders Sunny Patch Friends. I will no longer be speaking to her 
5872 What is there left to say that about this masterpiece? It breathes and bleeds with the utmost confidence by Coppola and company. Again, the performances are what make these films so legendary. The final shot will remain one of the most haunting yet cathartic scenes in film history as the audience is led to believe that all is well for Micheal Corleone. Such a wonderful film. American cinema at its finest.Happy Thanksgiving ü¶É 
5873  this movie is so long eventually it stops being a movie and just becomes a tone poem. you switch timelines and the one you were just in ceases to exist. it rains, it snows, everything is cold even in cuba. deniro floats in and out of his brando mumble. pacino ruins all his relationships and lies to himself and others about his character. fredo is there and he‚Äôs pathetic but you love him. you try and decide if hyman roth‚Ä¶  
5874 I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs because I knew what was coming a lot of the time (because of pop culture and me, not the script), or because I was still reeling from the first film: but I‚Äôll probably be rewatching both of these movies in the next few days. Also, I‚Äôm still reeling. And I really want to re-watch The Sopranos. 
5875 Somewhere towards the end, I felt a bit lost. In the first part, there was a difference between Don Vito and Don Michael. Vito had a strong aura of power. It radiated from him. Michael however knew that he was powerful. He didn't have to show it by any means. That's why I love Pacino. With what he did to Michael. And I'm glad that Bob reflected something similar with his role in the flashbacks. 
5876 A cinema perfection. 
5877  AFI Top 100: #32It would seem to anyone in their right mind that a sequel to one of the greatest films of the 20th-century would not be so good of an idea. However, Francis Ford Coppola wasted no time diving right back into the story of the Corleone crime family and in nearly flawless ways, might I add. The Godfather: Part II is a remarkable film that continues on the story paved out in its predecessor in ways that‚Ä¶  
5878 Kaum zu glauben, dass ein Meisterwerk wie der Pate eine Fortsetzungen bekommen kann, die nochmals besser ist als das Original. Vor allem die Rolle des jungen Vito ist De Niro wie auf den Leib geschneidert. Ihm beim Schauspielern in dieser Rolle zuzusehen w√§re auch nach Stunden nicht langweilig geworden.Coppola ist mit den beiden Der Pate Teilen ein Wunder passiert, dass in der Filmgeschichte einmalig ist. 
5879  The Godfather: Part II was yet another classic movie that I knew I had to watch if I wanted to call myself a cinephile. At the time of writing this, I only just saw the first one barely under a week ago. While I definitely liked that one better, this movie was incredible in its own right.¬†I was very impressed with The Godfather: Part II. The writing was great. So many lines from this film are nothing short of‚Ä¶  
5880  "I'll change. I've learned that I have the strength to change."An expansive and thematically rich follow-up that is every bit as good as the first film, if not better.

5882  Finally got around to watching this one and it definitely was spectacular to say the least.In some regard, I felt the same way I did about the first film: some of the first and second act were a bit slow (but I was still pretty entertained and it was still very well done even if I felt drag), but was saved but a phenomenal third act that makes you realize how fantastic the first two acts really are. It‚Ä¶

5885 Ok wow that was amazing. One of the main issues I had with part 1 was I found it near impossible to follow at times, but I didn't really find that the case at all with part 2. It's incredible how Coppola was able to thematically link two separate narratives within one film. I can really see why it's considered a masterpiece 
5886  "I don't feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom. Just my enemies."I remember always preferring the second film to the first, but after watching them back to back, I really can't pick which one is better because they are both so damn good. With this film we see the Corleone family being targeted and Don Michael is out for blood. In between we get flashbacks to young Vito Corleone as he rises to the top. This film has‚Ä¶

The world building is immaculate. In spite of the runtime the momentum this‚Ä¶  
5890  Ah, the crime drama genre, probably the most prestigious Hollywood genre, and one of my least beloved.Thankfully, The Godfather is the exception to the rule, because it understands that the ONLY way to make a crime drama truly resonant is to have the main character get gradually sucked into it from the outside. If the character is embroiled in organized crime from the outset (Goodfellas, Scarface) that inevitably puts a wedge between him and the audience.That being said,‚Ä¶  
5891  I think I've always sort of admired and respected The Godfather films more than I love them. This was my first go-around with this one in a long time, and this viewing confirmed that I do prefer the first film (if only for its compact, almost theatrical perfection), but this is a huge, sprawling opera of a film.

5895  This is obviously coming as no surprise to anyone, but The Godfather: Part II is possibly the best sequel ever made. There are other sequels I like more, but if we‚Äôre judging purely on how it stands compared to the original and what it had to live up to, then this is without a doubt the greatest sequel ever made.

5899  Although I liked the first Godfather better than this one, Michael Corleone is such a great character so it was nice to see have him as the focus this time; Al Pacino absolutely kills it.

5900 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Se fue a la mierda esta segunda parte con lo tremenda que es. Poder ver la historia de vito corleone con un robert de niro joven es de las cosas que m√°s le agradezco a francis coppola. La familia y sus dinamicas estan tan bien hechas que el final de esta pel√≠cula te destruye. No aguanto para volver a verla. Al Pacino como michael corleone hace una actuaci√≥n inolvidable.  
5901  I didn‚Äôt think it was possible, but I prefer this to the first one (although I think they are both incredible). It‚Äôs a lot of film to take in, but I loved it and can‚Äôt wait to rewatch it. It‚Äôs the perfect sequel and prequel, and both stories of it‚Äôs duel narrative are captivating. It‚Äôs looks amazing, with the lightbulb shot probably being one of my favourites. I love Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, and think his character is possibly‚Ä¶  
5902 i love how different this was from the first film, that it had showed more of who vito corleone was. his rise to power and the start of michael as the new don of the family. the ending through the last shot of al pacino gave me chills. the decision to have robert de niro play young vito was a great move as he nailed it here and i know it would have been pressuring to know that you are playing the role of an iconic character previously portrayed by a fantastic actor. it was a pure three-hour greatness. 
5903 us of italian descent be like 'this is my black panther'(waaaaaaay better than the first one btw)

5905 Great. Not as good as the first one, though. This worked really well as a prequel/sequel, contrasting Vito's rise with Michael's fall. It's fascinating. However, I was more invested in Vito's story than Michael's 
5906 ‚ÄúIf anything in this word is certain, if history has taught us anything, it‚Äôs that you can kill anyone.‚Äù ¬†~ Micheal CorleoneFrancis Ford Coppola crafts a sequel to rival part. 1 that operates as a prequel as well. Giving context to Vito‚Äôs rise to power and motivation for Micheal‚Äôs. Every character is developed to a T and is used to maximize the impact of the ending. *spoilers* they are either snugly under Micheal‚Äôs rule or on the floor bleeding to death. Truly one of the best of all time. 
5907  *Insert any line from the movie*Alright, like I said with the first film, this is a masterpiece of cinema, and everyone knows that. I guess it‚Äòs constantly being debated, which one of these two films is better. I myself prefer the first film. And to be even more honest, I would rewatch the first film and also Once Upon A Time In America before The Godfather Part II. This is still a huge and epic story, from every standpoint,‚Ä¶  
5908  This is the great American epic tragedy, and we'll probably never see anything quite like it again. An absolute miracle.Pacino's performance here is some Mount Rushmore stuff, up there with the best ever captured on film. It's astonishing the way he plays so much in reserve while still allowing the range of his work here to organically incorporate the rare instances when his emotions can't help but bubble up to the surface. It makes perfect sense to me that‚Ä¶  
5909 ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ¬Ω - 7 - really good / really likeI wish I could've loved this. I really enjoyed the scenes with Vito Corleone but I wasn't that interested in the rest. Ofc this movie is amazing on a technical level but I just couldn't keep me interested for it's really long runtime. 
5910  ‚Äú...keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.‚ÄùA fantastic follow up to The Godfather.

5911  The Godfather Part II is a 70s gangster sequel following the early life and career of Vito Corleone in 1920s New York City which is portrayed, while his son, Michael, expands and tightens his grip on the family crime syndicate.The most well known sequel to achieve the better than the original achievement and having watched the two of them for the first time today, I completely agree.

5913  I enjoyed the flashback sequences with De Niro as a young Vito Corleone. However, the courtroom scenes which begin after the 2 hour mark are tedious and add to the already jumbled plot of this movie. Godfather II has too many subplots going on. Diane Keaton's performance in this is stale and disappointing. The miscarriage/abortion is evidently out of place in this movie- it contrasts horribly with the rest of the movie. Since when are the Godfather films supposed to‚Ä¶  
5914 I expected this to happen and it did. I liked Part 1 but this was something I couldn't fully get into. It felt quite tedious at times especially most Michael related stuffs and I definitely felt that runtime. Most prequel stuffs with Don Vito were good though and best part of this in my opinion. I totally admire the craft that went into making this and the performances were all very good again. I can see why it's a classic and rated so highly but it wasn't something for me.

5922 Day 311IT‚ÄôS A WHOLE NEW GAME, DUNKACCINO! 
5923 Not only does The Godfather 2 manage to disprove the idea of sequels never being better than the original easily by improving upon the first movie in every concieveable way, but it also manages to be one of, if not thee greatest movie of all time. The original Godfather is a near perfect, but The Godfather 2? From the storytelling to the acting to all the technical aspects IS a perfect movie. 
5924 THIS IS PERFECTION AKSNSMNAVQKAKKZMSNANSMSNSB 
5925 I was going to rate this five stars, but then people would say "oh, you enjoyed it then?" and I can't really say that. I appreciated it and I appreciated the amount of work that was put into it, but I found it excruciatingly painful to sit through it and to continue paying attention. Like the first film, it's really well made and the actors are great (special mention for Robert De Niro's Italian), but I found nothing in it that held my attention other than a few isolated scenes. I guess these films just really aren't for me. 
5926 After only watching the first one a few hours earlier, this creates the greatest 7 hour epic ever put to film. Not to mention it also gives us some of the best character development I've ever seen in a movie. 
5927 Obviously greater than the first. A gradual rise with a gradual fall. Coppola‚Äôs signature dissolves elegantly weave the narratives or a hard jumpcut to evoke the passage of time. Pacino and De Niro giving the two greatest performances ever. Pacino‚Äôs quiet menace, erupting with masterful control. De Niro just disappearing and making the role his own. Every twist and turn, all 200 minutes, just iconic.

5930 I wish more films would do the sequel and the prequel at the same time. Especially in this economy. 
5931  5.0/5.0 = MasterpieceWhat is there to say really about a pure, perfect film? Not much. Especially one that has had decade's worth of analysis written about it already. What I will say is this: It's pretty amazing that although APOCALYPSE NOW has the larger set pieces, THE GODFATHER: PART II still somehow feels like the bigger movie. The entire 200-minute experience feels like consuming four seasons worth of television. There isn't one singular goal. Not one immediate conflict. Instead,‚Ä¶  
5932 Yes x2 
5933 Okay...you're right...it is pretty much the greatest movie ever made. I finally see it, after all these years. 
5934  "We was like the Roman Empire. The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire.""Yeah, it was once." what went wrong? the movie feels off, like it's trying too hard to create another masterpiece and falls flat. it's unrewatchable and honestly feels like it's almost capable of tainting part one. almost. that one's still deserving of its first place 
5935 Has there ever been a better prequel/sequel hybrid? Probably not. 
5936 In preparation for this movie, my mom and I made spaghetti and meatballs 
5937 A distinctively well-paced and sumptuously plotted drama with unforgettable performances from Pacino and De Niro, "The Godfather Part II" is an objectively perfect sequel to the 1972 classic. 
5938 people who say this is one of the greatest films ever made...have you seen other films? de niros's plot as young vito is good but jesus christ the rest is just dull crime politics. oh no my casino investment, oh no im in court, oh no my wife hates me. blah blah blah.if you want a real film about gangs in America and South America, look no further than Bad Boys 2. 
5939 It‚Äôs hard to say which movie I like more The Godfather or The Godfather Part 2. They are both tremendous masterpieces. 
5940 Robert De Niro is of course fantastic as young Don Vito but my favorite part‚Äôs always been Bruno Kirby as Young Clemenza! I‚Äôll personally always prefer the original but this film is probably the best sequel of all time. The third one‚Äôs gotta be even better, right? 
5941 In any other movie this much story would be a bloated mess, but every second is clear and compelling. BADA BING BADA BOOM!!! 
5942 *slaps 3 1/2 hour runtime* you can fit so much fuckin movie in this bad boy 
5943 Violence is a Sicilian artform.Still a perfect film! Happy Birthday to the great Francis Ford Coppola! 
5944  One story is of a man trying to maintain power over the family business. The other is of the man who came before to make it. Both are the tales told in The Godfather: Part II in a very European parallel narrative structure that would anticipate the nonlinear ways of Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in America. Coppola, with fantastic staging and pacing, brings out his now established cast and crew, with Robert De Niro taking on the role‚Ä¶  
5945 damn ma is it that serious 
5946 While the Godfather is one of the most well made films of all time this movie is superior (in my opinion) because it has what the first movie lacked, which is a sense of vulnerability 
5947 Simply put, yeah, this is a masterpiece. A 3.5 hr film that, for the most part, feels like it's less than two hours. A review of this film, from me, right now, at 3:30 in the morning, could not do it justice. Everything is near perfection, just like the original "The Godfather." Yeah, it's fantastic; nothing much to add to the conversation.Also, Harry Dean Stanton was in this film, and I somehow didn't know this before watching it. I love that.Blu-Ray, Coppola Restoration 
5948 Way too long for its own good, but there are so many great moments that the length almost doesn't matter. Watching the Corleone family drama unfold over the course of two compelling parallel storylines is fascinating alone. It should also be noted that young Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro could, and I cannot emphasize this enough, GET IT. 
5949 That ending really hit home. Beautiful movie. The relationship between Michael and Fredo was heartbreaking to watch.

5951 Scavenger Hunt 46Task 14: something with THE MOBSo you mean to tell me that Al Pacino won his oscar for shouting for 2.5 hours straight when this exists?

She‚Äôs there covering her face with a pillow way before anything occurs while I‚Äôm watching it closely and having no reaction to it, does that make me crazy?I think I may be crazy üòÇ 
5953  When absorbed together with its predecessor, "The Godfather: Part II" forms the true Noah's Ark of American narrative filmmaking. It's all there - murder, revenge, betrayal, intrigue, familial drama, corruption, fratricide, weddings, communions, baptisms, power ascent and moral descent...and so much more. All of it so familiar by now, it's quite easy to take for granted, because, as we all know - familiarity breeds contempt. But the breadth and depth of these films are so stunning, the mastery of each‚Ä¶  
5954 It took me a whole week to watch this completely, and maybe I would‚Äôve enjoyed it more if I viewed it all in one sitting. But the first movie is simply better on every level, and now I have the urge to rewatch it. 
5955 A big one off the list. Also one that I'll need to watch again at some point. Watching this right after the first one... I'm digging the first a bit more.¬†Loved the De Niro scenes and that final scene was great. 
5956  ‚ÄúIf anything in this life is certain, if history‚Äôs taught us anything, it‚Äôs that you can kill anyone.‚ÄùAl Pacino continues to masterfully protray the new Don Corleone as he grows further from the family, even as he fights to protect them. Michael doesn‚Äôt hold back at the end, and that climactic ending topped off an amazing experience.

You do forget just how deliberate the pacing is and if it was released now so many people would complain (like they did with the recent Bladerunner).3.5/5 for the Commentary, 5/5 for the Film.

5959 2018 What to Watch ChallengeWeek 8 - An Oscar winnerProgress - 6/52I really enjoyed this one through the intermission, and perhaps a bit further. But the ending was just so bleak that I found it to be a bit tough to finish. There's so much going on and once again it's amazing just how impressive of a film it is considering how long it is. Some really nice performances again, and I particularly liked De Niro as young Vito. I didn't mind that it was a prequel/sequel combo really. 
5960  Part of the third annual Audio Commentary Month.Godfather II is good but I still don't think the Vito timeline works as well as people say it does. In many ways G2 is more of a remake than a continuation. The two films mirror all of the iconic characters, like Frank Pentangel filling in for Clemenza, and Bussetta (The Man in Black) replacing Luca Brasi. The sequel also repeats the themes of betrayal, lies and closing the door on Diane‚Ä¶  
5961 I wish Robert de Niro was in this movie more, because Jesus was he amazing. 
5962  I was always a bit discouraged to watch The Godfather due to its run time. However, this weekend my dad insisted on watching it with me since it‚Äôs his all time favourite. It certainly was an experience. While I‚Äôm always the one mumbling useless facts about films, he was now the one telling me all the facts and information he had gathered over the years. Both Part I and Part II were skillfully intertwined and Al Pacino was absolutely captivating‚Ä¶  
5963 2018 REVIEW #2 | O FREDO, WHERE ART THOU?For being really fucking long, it doesn't feel fucking long. That's good filmmaking.I like this better than the first. I think it's richer, more stylized, more interesting... seeing where Michael has gone and what he transforms into is just satisfying in general. Robert De Niro is a splendid and superb surprise. Overall, it's just good. All I've said has been said already. 
5964 "At this moment, I feel no love for you at all. I never thought that would ever happen, but it has."Masterful. The birth and spiritual death of an empire, presented simultaneously. The iconic image of the young immigrant and future Godfather gazing upon the Statue of Liberty lingers in my mind as I watch Michael Corleone deprive himself of compassion and honour. One of the great films. 
5965  It‚Äôs been seven years since I‚Äôve seen either Godfathers and in that span of time, it‚Äôs become clearer to me just how many others have used these films as a reference point for calculated, dispassionate revenge. From Watchmen to Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones, there‚Äôs a bit of Michael and Vito in every post-1974 anti-hero.Some quick thoughts for posterity:‚Ä¢ Pronouncing Corleone in a way that rhymes with woebegone loosely translates to ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a death wish‚Äù in‚Ä¶  
5966 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   With The Godfather Part II, Francis Ford Coppola began a seemingly impossible task - follow up one of the all time greatest films. And considering the reputation of sequels, even to this day, it's impressive how well Part II, for all of it's hype and chance at failure, holds up not only as a sequel, but as a stand alone film it's in own right.Continuing on themes and ideas from the first film while expanding on the story we‚Ä¶

5970 Still as heart-wrenching as ever. Calling this the greatest sequel ever made does it a disservice in my opinion. I don't think I've ever seen a film that makes three and a half hours fly by as quickly as this one does.

5972 Intressanterweise ist der Film Sequel und ein Prequel und gilt als einer der besten Filme aller Zeiten. Alleine der Titel zeigt dieses an, was zu damaligen Zeiten eigentlich nicht gew√ºnscht war.Vielleicht muss man das im Hinterkopf haben, wenn man heutztage Hollywood mutlosigkeit vorwirft.Man darf aber nicht vergessen, dass in diesem Film wirklich harte Arbeit investiert wurde und das man in so ziemlich jedem Punkt des Films erkennen kann.

5973  After my viewing-and subsequent dazed writing-of Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather, I really psyched myself up for its sequel, what with it being considered one of the best sequels of all time, if not superior to the original film.But how can they make a movie that's better than perfection? Even if everyone came back for the production (save for Marlon Brando), and Coppola was still in his godliest, how can they pull it off?Turns out, they can't.Now‚Ä¶  
5974 Holy shit. I definitely prefer Part II to Part I. This one was even more ambitious and epic than the last and I loved it. The duality of Vito and Michael has left my wig in shambles. 
5975  The Godfather Part II may not have the extraordinary ending or knock-out Brando performance of its predecessor, but it‚Äôs actually a much more interesting and pleasurable watch, whilst making The Godfather look even better in the process as part of a greater whole. It follows the rise of the Corleone dynasty through a sense of heritage and loyalty with fellow Italian immigrants in the local community, incorporating them as part of the greater Corleone family, then simultaneously its decline as‚Ä¶  
5976  July Classics ChallengeYou've got to feel for Al Pacino. Across the first two parts of The Godfather he gives one of the best performances in American film history and yet still manages to get truly upstaged, by Brando and De Niro respectively, in both films.I certainly enjoyed this more than I enjoyed The Godfather on a first watch, but for now I still think the first installment is superior. Michael is a rather sympathetic protagonist (for this genre‚Ä¶

5978  Michael's arc in The Godfather is subtly tread. It is even more so in part II. This movie is always a rewarding rewatch because of his tiny character driven moments that are hidden in the complex plot. His unspoken agenda reveals itself slowly through his calculated attacks.

5981  I think I understand the idea of symmetry that Coppola introduced in "The Godfather Part II", which was then carried through into the final part as well, thus bringing all three films together and cementing the idea of them being a bona fide trilogy.

5984  The Godfather Part II, hailed as one of the greatest, if not the greatest sequel of all time. It's sharp quick, and does something that is very difficult to do when it comes to sequels. The Godfather, an adaptation to the best seller by Mario Puzo, was a masterpiece for it's portrayal of the business and family side of the mafia. To create a sequel with an almost entirely original story is risky. Issues can arise, as with many sequels.‚Ä¶  
5985 A truly ravishing and dark film that parallels Vito Corleone's rise from humble beginnings to Michael Corleone's descent into paranoia and darkness as it features an amazing cast as well as lush visuals as it's one of the rare sequels that is either better or as equal as its predecessor. "I know it was you Fredo! You broke my heart! You broke my heart!" 
5986  There is obviously an ongoing debate over whether this or the first film is the superior piece of work but ultimately I think I have to give my vote to the original classic. That being said - calling one of these films better than the other is a bit like having to choose between two very similar shades of your favorite color. They're both excellent and equally worthy of your attention.I think what ultimately sets them apart for me‚Ä¶

The jumping back and forth between Young Vito and Increasingly Eviler Michael isn't exact, which I will argue is a good thing, as it allows the connections to breathe and become more profound. In many ways, this is a cosmic piece about how one can never predict how one's actions will carry over to the next generation. (Exacerbated by how we only see the young versions of Clemenza and‚Ä¶  
5989  After watching Apocalypse Now yesterday, and having re-watched Godfather not too long ago, I decided now would be as good a time as any to watch Part II seeing as I couldn't really remember much/anything about it.

5990  I have always had a thing for Gangster movies and The Godfather Part II is the best. In weaving two parallel stories, that of Michael Corleone's personal decline as he expands his empire and Vito Corleone as he rises to head his crime family, Francis Ford Coppola creates a masterpiece I have enjoyed repeatedly.In my opinion this is Al Pacino's best performance. His Michael is no longer the naive son of the first movie but instead is a ruthless‚Ä¶  
5991 this one was definitely an improvement but it still didnt meet my expectations. i think that longer movies should make you feel engaged throughout the entire duration like you're watching a 1 hour movie. unfortunately most of them have the same issue there are only a few good scenes and the rest are just filler. nevertheless al pacino remains one of my favourite actors 
5992 Nobody can look as dead inside as Al Pacino. The latter third of the movie was soooo good, and Lauren pulled up an English script of the Italian parts so we could understand Vito's parts. Was a great time. 
5993 Not quite as good as the first, but still great. Love the flashbacks intertwined with the main plot.

6036 When the last movie about your life is made, nothing will be quite as good as it used to be, and the worst thing you ever did will keep coming up again and again. If that's not a haunting statement on what it's like to get old, I don't know what it is.(The ending is really good) 
6037  Let me explain. I've been watching the trilogy in sequence today with almost no breaks in between the films.I knew that this was the black sheep of the series going in. "The Godfather 3" has almost become a punchline over the years, especially with the previous two films being masterpieces.This film is nowhere near as dense as part two and the heart of the film (the father/daughter relationship) doesn't fucking work because Sophia Coppola can't act to save‚Ä¶  
6038 When you pause the movie multiple times to go watch scenes from the original Godfather. 
6039  So it‚Äôs been about sixteen years since I last watched The Godfather Part III. I saw it five or six times despite thinking it was subpar.

6040 As someone who has experienced The Godfather trilogy, I must say it's an unforgettable journey into the heart of organized crime and the twists of family loyalty. Each film is a masterpiece in its own right, with Francis Ford Coppola's direction drawing you into the intricate world of the Corleone family. 
6041  The violent history of the Corleone crime family did conclude on an ideal note in The Godfather Part II but thanks to the unquenchable greed of studio executives plus the dire financial circumstances director Francis Ford Coppola found himself in during that time, what was until then a perfectly flawless motion picture saga ultimately got tainted by a much inferior third instalment, which wasn't even required in the first place.Continuing the story of Michael Corleone, The Godfather Part III‚Ä¶  
6042 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Originally I was going to watch "Chinatown" for the first time, and review it, but since when I marathon a series, I prefer to finish said series as soon as possible. Guess what movie I'm planning on reviewing next then? Now onto the review.  The Godfather Part III is a 1990 American crime film written by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, and directed by Coppola. It completes the story of Michael Corleone, a Mafia kingpin who tries to legitimize‚Ä¶   
6043 My favorite in the trilogy. Don't @ me.Connie's arc throughout this series is the real gem and her complete fall to the darkness here is something to behold. 
6044  I don‚Äôt know what I see in this movie that others don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs not what I don‚Äôt see because I‚Äôm certainly aware of its flaws, but I somehow don‚Äôt seem to mind. I think I‚Äôll go to my grave defending True Detective Season 2, Quantum of Solace, and this. It might be its looks that I‚Äôm in love with. A film set in the seventies, made in the nineties, and one that belongs to neither decade, full of rich browns‚Ä¶  
6045 I love the way the opening act of this film is structured now. It still has some problems but the tone set by that first half hour really changes the feeling of the film overall. And Pacino and Garcia are even better than I remembered. Full review tomorrow. 
6046 Wow, what a journey this trilogy has been. So sinister and evil. This one was beautiful. The settings in this one were out of this world. It was exactly what you‚Äôd expect from a Godfather movie. The opera scenes especially were superb. I feel like I‚Äôm now apart of this Italian family and I better watch my back. 
6047 I saw the new Coda cut, but I‚Äôve never seen the original so I don‚Äôt really know what the differences were. It‚Äôs not a bad movie, but I will say that Sofia Coppola‚Äôs acting is terrible, and every single line she utters is an awkward, clunky mess.Coppola‚Äôs acting isn‚Äôt the worst thing about the film though, that honor goes to the incest subplot. I wonder why anyone would think it was a good idea, not only to have an incest story, but to also have it be acted by the daughter of the director. I would love to know how awkward filming that was. 
6048 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   I watched the recently released cut entitled The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone. I used to say that The Godfather: Part III was a 2 minute ending with a needless 150 minute prologue. On a rewatch, even with the new cut, I feel the same. All this film exists to do is kill off Michael Corleone in its last scene. If we want to extend this a bit further, the film's purpose is to kill off Michael's daughter‚Ä¶

6056  64 (The Coppola Restoration)My first time watching the Godfather Part III is about as disappointing as I expected it to be. I had only previously watched the first two installments because I had always heard terrible things about the third. It is not bad. But, to be frank, it‚Äôs not great. The story is convoluted, it has some subpar acting from most of the cast (no reason to exclusively hate on Sofia Coppola), weaker dialogue and many contrivances. The‚Ä¶  
6057 The Spider-Man 3 of the trilogy.Come on, it‚Äôs not as ‚Äúbad‚Äù¬†as everyone else said. 
6058 A dip in quality compared to the other two Godfather movies, but still pretty solid. There are inspired moments throughout, but the story isn't as gripping overall I think.The performances are good for the most part, except for Sophia Coppola's; she often comes across as wooden. She should definitely stick to directing because that seems to be her forte.I loved the over-the-top gangster massacre by helicopter, and the little callbacks to the previous installments were fun too.Garc√≠a's and Coppola's first cousin romance was.. pretty crazy!Fun times watching this with a raspy voiced Michelle. 
6059 Everyone can clown on this truly alien Sofia Coppola performance, nepo this, baby that, but if you were a nice father who was also a maniac you'd also let your weird daughter obliterate your franchise for love so no judgies! Three stars! 
6060 This film is by far the worst out of the three. I felt like it was over run by Hollywood and had sloppy acting/writing.¬†It was a unnecessary film to of been made especially after the incredible first two.¬†Speaking of things being unnescessary, what was the need of having some twisted, shitty incest storyline?! Not to mention Sofia Coppola‚Äôs stale ass performance which is almost unwatchable. 
6061  What a disappointing final chapter for The Godfather trilogy. I had relatively low expectations for Part III, but I was feeling excited to watch it at the same time since the first two films were so memorable. I didn't find it bad, but it certainly had many problems. I didn't like how they wrapped the whole Fredo story arc in only a couple of minutes, so I thought that was a wasted opportunity.

6062 Coppola produces a work that turns the previous two inside out. it doesn't just mirror and echo the previous two, but re-stages them. this isn't the ode to silent cinema, but a real fresco; an anti-Godfather film that extends every theme that made the first two iconic, but with a beating human operatic heart. the stark chiaroscuro of cynical pragmatism brushed aside for tableaux of loss, longing, and desire. 
6063 The title is way longer, but the movie is way shorter. Full review at ScreenCrush. 
6064 1990 was one hell of a year for Italian Americans in cinema, and yet what a fugazi this was! 
6065  Honestly, I could see what Part III was trying to accomplish. Coppola himself has admitted the the first two Godfathers are the real story and Part III is just an epilogue. Here, we have the film start off much like how the first film began: Michael, being the Don, hosting an important party for the family dealing with a son that wants nothing to do with the business. However, while with Vito everyone was happy and enjoying themselves with a‚Ä¶

6067  My 1000th entry!The Godfather III is more about the regrets of a shattered old man than a mafia crime drama. While this movie is nowhere near the lustre of its way older predecessors, the series still ended on a high note. The stunning performances of Andy Garcia and Al Pacino wowed especially on solid sequences that required foolproof acting. Bigger exposures for both Talia Shire and Dianne Keaton proved necessary as they shined when needed. Most importantly, Sofia Coppola‚Ä¶

6074  Some films induce you to put ungodly expectations on them because of the source subject, the stars, the director. Through the years many have come down hard on The Godfather Part III because there was no way it could outdo, and overpower, the previous two installments. I had seen Part III long ago and was at the time left hazy, dissatisfied. I wanted to watch it again with fresh eyes and moderate expectations. Francis Ford Coppola, still capable at this‚Ä¶  
6075  "The Godfather Part III," the concluding chapter of Francis Ford Coppola's iconic mafia trilogy, remains the weakest link despite its ambitions and visual finesse. Released in 1990, the film failed to meet the high expectations set by its predecessors, leaving a divisive impression.The plot unfolds a few decades after the events of the second installment, following Michael Corleone's (Al Pacino) efforts to overcome his family's criminal past and pursue a legitimate path. However, despite the promising premise, the story‚Ä¶

Also, Sofia Coppola can't act.Beyond that though, the film has amazing performances (Sofia Coppola may not be one of them,‚Ä¶

And the epic drama feel gears up to something much soapy. Despite these minor issues, this last installment is filled with so many‚Ä¶  
6084 Overhated! 
6085 People say the worst thing about The Godfather: Part III is Sofia Coppola‚Äôs acting when, in fact, it‚Äôs Al Pacino‚Äôs hair -- I can‚Äôt believe we were robbed of the suave sophistication Michael Corleone should‚Äôve had.

6088 Not necessary, and not as giant as its prequels, but still a memorable mafia film, with a good conclusion. It carried the weight of its past stories; there was its source of advantage. Glad to know Sofia stayed behind the camera.Oh wait...71/100 
6089 Three stars for the movie, and one star for the last half hour. Everything happening in and around the opera was something. Pacino gives a haunting performance as Micheal. Andy Garcia gave a solid performance, but it seemed rushed.¬†Anyways unless you are a completist, you can skip this entry. 
6090 Although this doesn‚Äôt come close to the previous films, it‚Äôs great and worthy of concluding one of the most iconic trilogies in cinema.Francis Coppola definitely took a risky approach with this film but it turned out just fine.

6096 the third act goes crazy. 
6097 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Coda: The Death of Michael CorleoneDoesn‚Äôt deserve the hate it gets. Some people would argue its only crime is not being as good as two of the greatest movies ever made. As much as I love this movie even I couldn‚Äôt argue that point. Its problems extend beyond falling short of the greatness of its predecessors. The movie suffers from the very themes it tries to explore: hubris and greed.In the film Michael‚Äôs arrogance prevents him from entertaining‚Ä¶   
6098  First review: letterboxd.com/thommy1801/film/the-godfather-part-iii/Yes, compared to the first two movies, Part III is disappointing and yes, it wasn¬¥t really necessary in the first place, but it¬¥s not a horrible film.Direction, cinematography, editing, and production design are topnotch, the Italian set pieces are beautiful, the score is as wonderful as always, and the plot is engaging and captivating, though the intrigues and twists are less shocking and heartbreaking than in the previous movies.My favorite aspect of the plot is‚Ä¶  
6099  [Coda version]Braced myself for the worst, which probably helped sell it a little better. There‚Äôs a decent enough revenge plot, and the addition of Andy Garcia grew on me the more it went on (outside of the misplaced cousin plot - this is Dexter Season 6 all over again!).But there is an almost amateurish and tension-lacking quality when compared to the first two parts.

6100  The Godfather: Part III ---- 1990The Godfather: Part III starts off in 1979.By this time Michael is near the end of his Career at the head of the Corleone family empire. In fact he probably wouldn't mind walking away from it all if he had the chance.But there are a few things that are out of his control. Like say, for instance, his nephew Vincent coming back into his life. Vincent can be a smart man with‚Ä¶  
6101 Minus a certain indivdual‚Äôs performance, I genuinely believe this to be on the same level as the other two films and serve as a satisfying ending to the trilogy. I‚Äôm mainly just impressed and how it feels like a continuation of the previous films even after such a large time gap.Come at me if you must, but I enjoyed this just as much as the others.Viewed Martin Scorsese‚Äôs personal 35mm print from 1990. 
6102 meh this isn‚Äôt THAT bad as some people say 
6103  Al Pacino carried this entire franchise (not really but I just love his performance in every film). While part 3 of The Godfather is my least favourite of the trilogy I think it‚Äôs super underrated. The 3.4 average on here is blasphemous to me, sure it‚Äôs not as strong as the other two but it‚Äôs still a great film. The only issue I can really find with it is Sofia Coppola‚Äôs acting which is pretty horrendous but other than that‚Ä¶  
6104 It's quite amazing how Sofia Coppola started the 90's with this awful performance and 9 years later she made one of the best films of that decade or at least one of my favourites.After watching this I thought that maybe I should rewatch the first two films, compared to this they're actually masterpieces and I should appreciate them more. Also, I'm not really sure this even needed to exist, nothing remotely interesting happens and it doesn't feel like Francis Ford Coppola directed this at all, it's just a big mess that not even Al Pacino or Diane Keaton could make better. 
6105 A √∫ltima vez que eu vi "O Poderoso Chef√£o - Parte III" foi h√° 24 anos. E eu n√£o tinha a mem√≥ria de um grande filme. Nada mais errado. Que filme maravilhoso, que bel√≠ssima conversa com o resto da obra, que coer√™ncia! E quantas cenas impec√°veis! Se a escala√ß√£o tapa-buraco de Sofia Coppola deixa muito a desejar, h√° Al Pacino magistral, Andy Garcia reeditando James Caan lindamente e Talia Shire monstruosa, elevando Connie a um papel de protagonismo. Que bela homenagem √† mem√≥ria! 
6106  Welp. Finally got around to it, I guess.I don't think there's much that needs to be said about the first two "Godfather" films. They're both near, (if not exact) perfection, and two of the absolute greatest films ever made. They're classics for a reason. Not too long ago I had the opportunity to see the first "Godfather" again in a Dolby theater for its 50th anniversary. It was fucking incredible and it blew my mind. A couple of days‚Ä¶  
6107  I mean, it's pretty good! People act like it's a sin against cinema but c'mon it's a decent movie. I do have problems with it though. It doesn't feel as grandiose or important as the first two, especially Part II. It just kinda feels like Michael is slowly walking through this final chapter of his life as things around him are just as crazy as they ever were. And I get that this could be reflective of how Michael's getting‚Ä¶

Yet it's a film whose vices are rarely ever brought to the‚Ä¶

6110 yes.I‚Äòm a slut for Al Pacino, again...I wish I could give this more, but there were too many things that were annoying me, starting with Sofia‚Äôs acting (ily tho), the whole incest shit and some other small details.So you could say that all the stars belong to Al Pacino and Al Pacino only....and to the beautiful art direction! 
6111 Part III surprised me positively!! I enjoyed Part I & Part II¬†just as much, but I had way higher expectations for them. Great ending for the Corleone saga. 
6112   Godfather III was always the Fredo of Godfather movies, weak and flawed compared to its two siblings. Simply by renaming it The Godfather Coda, Coppola makes it a better film by delinking expectations from the twin towers and enhancing its elegiac tone. ‚ÄúI had a whole different destiny planned.‚Äù As we know from Donnie Brasco and The Sopranos, the mafia is in decline in the 1990s, so what more perfect metaphor than a declining Godfather movie. Not just Michael Corleone‚Ä¶

6114 No doubt struggles to uphold the same acclaim or significance as the first two movies but it‚Äôs good in its own 60 year old Michael Corleone kind of way.¬†More about coming to terms with the past and finding a successor for the Corleone business than a mob movie with an endless amount of blood and violence. It‚Äôs still there but definitely toned down in favor of a more dialogue driven story. 
6115 I watched Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone.I‚Äôve never had a Godfather Part III issue. It doesn‚Äôt stand with the other two, but it‚Äôs pretty fucking fun.¬†Too much sloppy exposition.¬†But Andy Garcia OWNS!I think this new edit and the original edit are about equal in weight, but I‚Äôll probably only watch the new version from here on out. 
6116  This review is for "The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone" This does not deserve the hate it gets at all. I can see why it's not as beloved as the other two but in my opinion I think it's so much better than the second. I've not watched The Godfather 3 theatrical version, so I have no idea how much it differs from Coda, but will definitely be watching that version too to compare. It's by no means‚Ä¶  
6117  The third installment made after 16 years is indeed a solid movie, but since the other two are exemplary masterpieces, it ends up giving the feel of an unnecessarily made sequel. The story is passable as a standalone, but considering the franchise, it is weak lacking the intensity and impact. It covers the aged Michael Corleone‚Äôs moral regrets, takes effort to legitimize his criminal empire and choosing his next protege. Al Pacino performance gets more fluid and unsuited this time‚Ä¶  
6118  In all fairness, The Godfather Part III wasn‚Äôt really the fault of Francis Ford Coppola. His 1982 musical drama One from the Heart, despite coming only three years after the incredibly successful Apocalypse Now, bombed so badly that he was soon facing serious financial issues, leaving him with only two options: direct, produce, and co-write (with, as always, Mario Puzo, author of the novels from which the Godfather films came) another Godfather film like Paramount really wanted him to do,‚Ä¶  
6119 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  OMG I didn't know Mary and Vincent were from Santiago del Estero  
6120  It‚Äôs barely 10 minutes in and Michael Corleone‚Äôs face breaks into a broad grin and already this feels like a very different film to its predecessor. I know in real life many men who have been hard as nails begin to develop a sentimental streak as they get older, but what can be a relief in real life is the opposite when it comes to the brilliant fictional character of Michael Corleone. Sentimentality was central to the tension in The‚Ä¶  
6121  Being that its reputation over the years has been one where it's known for being a highly inferior cap to the Godfather trilogy, I fully expected The Godfather Part III to be a massive step down going in. That's why I was happy when it turned out that I did not find this to be the disaster many think it is, even if it is definitely nowhere near the greatness of its two predecessors. I definitely understand why a lot‚Ä¶  
6122  Is it really that bad?To answer the question quickly probably not but compared to its predecessors it really is a stinking pile of shit. However there are reasons to that to Francis Ford Coppola losing his touch after filming Apocalypse Now, the filming/writing being rushed and actors dropping out therefore you can‚Äôt hate on it that much.¬†The Godfather Part 3 is however quite good at showing the collapse of crime empire with the Corleone touch just not being‚Ä¶  
6123 This was actually not as bad as everyone says. Of course it's not on the same level as the first two but I liked it. The thing that really brings this movie down is Sofia Coppola. And what's going on with the incest? 
6124  Ok, this is apparently an unpopular opinion, but I really enjoyed this film. I agree, ‚ÄúThe Godfather Part III" is not a masterpiece like its two predecessors or Scorsese's ‚ÄúGoodFellas", but it still is a great mafia film and a mostly satisfying ending to Michael Corleone's story.I just love the immersive world Francis Ford Coppola creates in his Godfather movies, this elegant but morally corrupt parallel society, where organized crime mingles with politics, big business, and the Church. In‚Ä¶  
6125 I mean, it‚Äôs not terrible, mostly because the story and beats are still interesting enough. But even though I wasn‚Äôt the biggest fan of the first film in the trilogy, I will say that with the milquetoast directing as well as the work in basically every technical department, this is the first film in the trilogy that feels like it could have been made by anyone. Especially with Sofia Coppola‚Äôs subpar acting job that proves she‚Äôs much better behind the camera.

6131 A disappointing conclusion to what was until this point a magnificent series of films, Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather: Part III still retains the gorgeous cinematography and (mostly) fantastic performances from its predecessors but lets them down with sluggish pacing and a needlessly muddled script with bland, subpar characterization. 
6132  Reviewing "Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone":I loved this. I've never seen the original Part III and chose to watch this version first because of Coppola's insistence that this is the movie he original envisioned and I'm so glad that I did. I thought the story was engaging and I loved following Michael's journey as he struggles with his inner turmoil while now being in a similar position that his father was in the first film.

6138  This is good! Not only is it good, it's great! It perfectly ends the trilogy, leading to the only logical conclusion‚ÄîMichael truly losing everything. It's about an old man who has to confront and pay for what he's done, who lives with regret and the inability to escape these regrets, whose past catches up to him and refuses to let him go, a man who wants to seek redemption and forgiveness but doesn't know where to begin. It's incredibly moving‚Ä¶

6140  There are flashes of the old greatness ("Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in"), but also jarringly clunky, klaxon-alarm-activating flaws that were completely absent in its legendary forebears ("Why does Sicily, such a beautiful place, have such a history of violence?") Where Parts 1 and 2 were masterclasses in understatement, Part 3 is more openly melodramatic, with characters just straight up announcing their thoughts more often than is ideal. Still, this feels like a harsh‚Ä¶  
6141 ‚ÄúNever hate your enemies. It affects your judgment.‚ÄùThis should have been as great as the first two. It has a diabetic don, twin henchmen, death by eyeglasses... but the incest storyline dwarfs all of that for me. Even Sophie was skeezed out by it. 
6142  The question that was on everybodys lips regarding this film, including mine and still one I hear to this day...should this film have been made? Coppola himself said that he was rushed into making and finishing it, some of the cast refusing to return because as Duvall said at the time, the only reason they are making it because of the money. You could argue that this film was the precursor to the world of cinema we have now bloated‚Ä¶  
6143  Just when I thought I was out... They pull me back in.I think the main reason this film is so skewered by fans and critics alike is because it followed the heels of a film that would give it unrealistically high expectations. After 1979's successful Apocalypse Now, Francis Ford Coppola appeared to be having issues producing another success to match his three (four if you're like me and love The Conversation) crowning achievements. Granted, The Outsiders wasn't inherently awful,‚Ä¶  
6144  NOTE: This is for The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone.First time watching this cut of The Godfather: Part III and though I saw the original version almost two years ago, I do think that this recut is a bit better and improves upon a very good, but flawed, film. Even with the original version, I've never disliked it, but the (relatively minor) changes this version makes do help with the pacing and flow of the story, especially‚Ä¶  
6145 Of course this is not a bad movie, but compared to the other three of the trilogy is the weakest. There are some choices that I don't understand like the one on the character of Tom Hagen: completely deleted by this movie, we only know that he died of natural causes. A so important character treated like that... shame on you. 
6146 ‚ÄúAll the power on earth can‚Äôt change destiny.‚ÄùUnderrated. At the end of the day the movie enhances our understanding and appreciation of probably one of the best fictional characters today Micheal Corleone and how that characters story ends. Vincent was really good in this I like how he gives the menacing energy that was missing without Sonny. One of my biggest complaints about the film is that at some parts feel like they just don‚Äôt belong in the movie from time to time for example, the helicopter assault. A big congratulations to Al Pacino for being amazing as always. 
6147 (Mario Puzo's The Godfather, Coda: "The Death of Michael Corleone")I always liked III more than consensus, I don't know it well enough to compare it precisely with this recut version but it seems to flow better and more clearly than the original, or maybe I'm just better at following plots than I used to be. Standout scenes as always are the ending and Michael's stroke in the kitchen, shouting Fredo's name, both of which always make me tear up a little. Cent'anni, Francis.

6149  Should people be pulled back in on a new version of The Godfather, Part III?A few years ago I reviewed III; I've never held the opinion that this was bad, even when first seen by me more than two decades ago.

6156 For every moment of genuine inspiration in The Godfather: Part III, there are just as many moments that come off tedious, overwrought, or unintentionally funny. The real dramatic heft of the previous two Godfather films is totally absent here, with this third entry feeling like an unnecessary epilogue to the series rather than trying to work as a successful standalone film. Al Pacino gives his all and the movie is handsomely crafted, but as this disappointing finale shows, Francis Ford Coppola was made an offer that he really should have refused.

Maybe they'll just take out all of Sophie Coppola's scenes.

6166  This is my 200th watched film of the year!!! My 100th was the first Godfather, so it only felt right to watch this today. I will have a very special review coming soon when I watch 202 films (my goal for the year), because I will make some special thanks. Anyways, to the review!So I've finally seen the whole Godfather Trilogy. Feels good, honesty. Except, this one. It doesn't feel good. It feels good to have watched them, but‚Ä¶  
6167 I prefer Part 2 being the true ending to the series. It lacks any reason to exist, it‚Äôs plot is pretty scattered and at times can be pretty boring. Sofia Coppola‚Äôs performance is laughably bad and serves nothing to the movie except for the infamous incest subplot. Al Pacino was hit and miss in some places and some scenes were okay, but it‚Äôs a major letdown compared to the first two and how engaging those characters were. Also, not having Tom Hagen in the movie is already a bad sign3.5/10

6169  What do you want to say at the end of one of the most legendary trilogies. At the beginning you definitely notice that the ending was not planned but the longer the movie goes the stronger it gets and especially the happier it makes me as a huge fan of the trilogy that it was shot after all, because the character Michael corleone and the whole epic get a memorable ending.¬†But let's begin with the start, where everything feels‚Ä¶  
6170  Film #4 of the 100 Degrees, 100 Movies ChallengeCommon actor from previous film: Diane KeatonPREVIOUS FILM: The Godfather: Part IINEXT FILM: Jackie BrownEasily the worst part of The Godfather trilogy, Part III offers glimpses of the masterpiece that was the first two movies but falls victim to its many flaws.First the good. Al Pacino, of course is amazing as Michael Corleone once again. Newcomers to the trilogy Andy Garcia and Joe Mantegna are both excellent‚Ä¶  
6171  Considered the lesser of the three, this is still a powerful film. The Godfather and The Godfather Part II stand alone as arguably the two greatest crime films ever made. Taking the story that one step further with Part III was considered a mistake by some, but still delivers a lesson in storytelling that most movies can only dream about. Epic, grandiose, and with a complex and sometimes convoluted plot, this tries desperately just like Michael Corleone himself to distance‚Ä¶  
6172  So... The Godfather Part III is not a baaaaaaad film, but when you're the sequel of two Best Picture winners, it's obvious it wouldn't hold up to those standards, much like Spider-Man 3 or the Matrix sequels (Revolutions to a lesser extent).Seeing a more mature and tired Michael Corleone, with Pacino's voice change that coincidentally fits so well with Michael's own regretful nature in Part III. As we explore his last journey for forgiveness and peacefulness before an attack‚Ä¶  
6173 Definitely the weakest of the three, but it would‚Äôve been pretty hard to equal let alone top the first two.¬†The incest was super skeezy, and Sofia Coppola‚Äôs acting is just plain terrible throughout most of it. Still love it though, especially when you add In Bridget Fonda, Andy Garcia, Joe Mantegna and Eli Wallach. I cheered when Marty Scorsese‚Äôs mom randomly showed up. üéâShout out to a pretty inventive way to kill someone- ü§ìHad a blast watching this with Lou on the first day of my sudden 7 day post-vacation vacation. ü§í 
6174  Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in.It's not bad, but in comparison to the other two, it's really sticks out like a sore thumb. It looks just as beautiful I'm many areas and, for the most part, the acting is just as good, but it doesn't feel like the slow-burn mafia-drama as the other two. This honestly feels more in line with something like Gangster Squad or a Guy Ritchie flick than Goodfellas or‚Ä¶

6181  The Godfather Pt III is a great movie that happens to have a really big problem. I watched the new Coda version that was released for the 30th anniversary, and I have to admit, that it really doesn‚Äôt change much to make the film better or worse. I never hated this movie; it just happens that I feel that Sofia Coppola was a bad choice for such an important role, her line delivery was some of the worst I had‚Ä¶  
6182  The immediate problem that one will run into when attempting to follow up the first two excellent Godfather films that defined all of cinema is that the ending of the second film really didn‚Äôt leave much room for a sequel. Our main character, Michael Corelone, was still alive and kicking, and still relatively young. But his arc had been completed. We witnessed the absolute failure of the American dream as Vito Corleone‚Äôs empire rose up and eventually ruined Michael‚Äôs life‚Ä¶  
6183  Part III¬†opens familiarly with a celebration and reunion amongst the Corleone‚Äôs, and then continues with rocky ups and downs that reveal it is in fact: a shell of its predecessors. Yes, following both The Godfather¬†and The Godfather: Part II¬†would be an impossible task for Coppola or for humanity to even fathom, but nonetheless I have these head-scratching moments to question. Unfortunately, this is the one time where an entry in The Godfather trilogy fulfilling its reputation/consesus is less satisfying. Part‚Ä¶

6188  Finishing off The Godfather trilogy, Part III is by far the weakest movie, but it isn't all bad. Francis Ford Coppola's first movie released in the 90s is a minor improvement on the movies that came in the previous decade but still nowhere near the heights of his 70s run of movies.The story in this movie picks up when Michael Corleone is a much older person and it is a movie about regret and trying to make things right.‚Ä¶

6192 Had to rewatch before I try out Francis Coppola‚Äôs new version of this nigh-classic. I‚Äôve always thought this was highly underrated and wrongly maligned. What I didn‚Äôt expect was that this hit all the notes for me that last years The Irishman was trying and (in my opinion) failed to place. 
6193  Besser als sein Ruf? Nun, der dritte Teil der The Godfather - Reihe hat bei mir nach dem Rewatch wieder f√ºr zwiesp√§ltige Gef√ºhle gesorgt. Auf der einen Seite ist der Film nicht ann√§hernd so dramaturgisch stark und so unglaublich fesselnd wie die beiden monumentalen Vorg√§nger, es gibt zum Beispiel wenig beeindruckende Performances von der Regisseurs-Tochter - und sp√§teren selbst in diesem Fach brillierenden - Sofia Coppola sowie manch anderen hier beteiligten Schauspieler/innen. Auf der anderen Seite sind da stark aufgebaute‚Ä¶

6195 A continuation of the greek tragedy themes of ‚ÄúPart II‚Äù, told incredibly beautifully through the stellar cast (including Sofia), the breathtaking cinematography, and Coppola‚Äôs unique vision on the final moments of Michael Corleone‚Äôs life. I really don‚Äôt see how anyone could do any better with the film and quite honestly gave me ‚ÄúTwin Peaks‚Äù vibes. I wonder if this inspired Lucas with his prequel trilogy, I think it‚Äôs an incredibly beautiful film and a perfect way to end one of the greatest trilogies of all time. Seriously, this might be my favorite looking ‚ÄúGodfather‚Äù film, it‚Äôs so damn beautiful. 
6196 Rarely is the film‚Äôs IMDb trivia page is more entertaining than the film itself.Not an awful film, just a shame it‚Äôll always be compared to the other twoSofia Coppola. Haven‚Äôt any idea how she could‚Äôve landed a role like this but she was shocking and I‚Äôm sure she hasn‚Äôt gone on to do anything else in Hollywood since. 
6197  I watched the first two¬†Godfathers before I watched this but I didn‚Äôt review them because effort, they‚Äôre a 5/5. I haven‚Äôt seen this in probably 10 years, I never hated it, I liked it just fine for what it was, obviously it‚Äôs nowhere near as great as the first two. I watched The Godfather III director‚Äôs cut entitled Godfather, Coda.¬†I am not familiar enough with part III to tell the difference between the original and this version but I will‚Ä¶  
6198  ok yeah, that wasn‚Äôt good. It wasn‚Äôt bad or awful but it lacked heart. Now let‚Äôs not have heart be mistaken for nostalgia. There were a lot of moments you could see right through were just pumped through with little moments or lines that served no purpose but to make you think about the other two movies (mainly showed through with flashbacks/photos.) ¬†my main problem with this movie is that it really lacked an arc for really any character.‚Ä¶  
6199  ‚ÄúI swear, on the lives of my children: Give me a chance to redeem myself, and I will sin, no more.‚ÄùNot the full picture of its predecessors, but I do think The Godfather: Part III shines brightly in its own regards.

6200  Count no man happy till he dies, free of pain at last ‚Äî after wiping away my tears, those words of Aeschylus‚Äô chorus rang in my head as Coppola denies Michael a death, a freedom from pain, at the end of The Death of Michael Corleone, his official Coda. ‚ÄúThere will be no forgiveness.‚Äù The door is shut on Kay at the end of The Godfather¬†and the¬†door is shut on Michael by Kay at the beginning of The Godfather¬†Coda.

6201  Al Pacino‚Äôs hair is deeply inspiring to me. Robert Duvall not returning should have completely shut down production. I would have paid him anything to come back. I also would have paid anything to replace Sofia Coppola as Michael‚Äôs daughter. Sry! (She apparently replaced Winona Ryder at the legit last minute due to illness.)There is a bizarre scene at the onset where her and Andy Garcia heavily flirt and reminisce about their first meeting when he was 15 and‚Ä¶  
6202 a dip in scale on the grandness factor, but damn part 3 still slaps. a fitting conclusion to one of the most amazing trilogies of all time. the scream that pacino belts at the end had me deep in the feels: culmination of 3 films, & one amazing ass role.¬†all i can say is ‚Äî what a set of magnificent motion pictures. 
6203  Revionism works best when the original iteration of the movie was compromised in some way. 'Heaven's Gate', 'Once Upon A Time In America', 'Kingdom Of Heaven', 'The Abyss', and 'Almost Famous' are all great movies that were somehow diminished in the form by which they were originally viewed by the majority of the public, before being restored to their full glory later on, when their respective directors no longer had to make their concessions to studio interference, time pressures, or‚Ä¶  
6204  Like many, I practically worship the genius of Coppola's first two Godfather films, and yet it took me this long to come around to watching the trilogy's finale. I let the less-than-stellar reputation of the film deter me, but with the new Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone, I thought it an interesting idea to make Coppola's recut version of the film my initial exposure to the material.

6209  THE GODFATHER: PART III is the weakest in the trilogy but it‚Äôs not a terrible film and isn‚Äôt worth the serious dunking on that it has received. The acting is great (except for Sofia Coppola who is a much better director than actor) and there are some wonderful sequences. The opera performance intercut with the various assassinations happening at the same time was beautifully edited together. That alone makes it worth seeing. Note: I watched The Godfather, Code: The Death‚Ä¶  
6210  It took weeks of procrastination but I finally watched this. Let's just say it was definitely not worth the wait. My god it was so fucking boring.

Any scene where something actually happened was allright. The helicopter scene, a few shootings and the‚Ä¶  
6211  I don‚Äôt think anyone actually believes this film was needed. Not fans, not director Francis Ford Coppola and definitely not the actors, who in the case of Pacino and Keaton were induced with considerable paychecks. Nonetheless, I‚Äôm a firm believer in cinematic object permanence, which is to say just because you wish a film out of existence (something so-called ‚ÄúStar Wars fans‚Äù love to do), doesn‚Äôt make it true. ‚ÄúThe Godfather Part III‚Äù (or ‚ÄúThe Godfather Coda‚Äù rather, which is‚Ä¶

In all honesty Godfather 3 never stuck with me, like it‚Äôs good but who gives a shit. 
6213 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   "When they come, they come at what you love."I just want to come out with saying I don't necessarily hate this film, it's just mundane and inconsistent in comparison to what I've come to expect of The Godfather from the first two films.I feel like this movie was doomed from the start. How was it supposed to compete with, or even match the first two films in the trilogy, which are widely regarded as the bests in all‚Ä¶   
6214  I had somehow never seen most of this movie. Certain scenes, sure, but not most of them, and certainly not in a set order. Sophia Coppola always gets killed for her performance as Mary, but she's mostly fine? Other than the final scene (bad time to be at one's worst, I know) she's pretty passable. Now Franc D'Ambrosio as Anthony Corleone is just a total lead balloon. No, my biggest complaints are the uneven pacing and that parts of the‚Ä¶  
6215  An older and wiser Don Corleone wants so badly to turn the family business legitimate, but things do not go the way he wants, at all...I know what people are thinking. Why do you grade this movie as highly as the first two? I discovered The Godfather and The Godfather Part II at that exact moment in time when I surrendered completely to my love of movies. They both were partially responsible for the formation of my cinematic soul.‚Ä¶  
6216  Concluding (Until I decide to watch Coda) The Godfather trilogy with 1990's Part Three. I know this one gets a lot of slack but I remember liking it when I first watched it. It wasn't as good as Part One and Two but it was still compelling so I wanted to see how I felt about it the second time around. Part Three follows an older Michael (Al Pacino), now wrecked with guilt over everything he has done, as he‚Ä¶  
6217 Surely, not at the level of the first two films. It's far away from perfect, but not that bad. It's just good. It had two masterpieces coming out before and it was difficult for it to reach those two. Great trilogy as a whole.

6219  I Betrayed Myself.The reason behind my rewatch of The Godfather Trilogy was the release of the new edit of the third installment: The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone.Where I wasn't too familiar with the original edit, I remember the film being to a lesser standard than the first, but this new edit treats the film as a much more sombre epilogue to the series rather than the 'third part' that was forced by Paramount.Coda does‚Ä¶  
6220  7/10This film wrapped up the iconic trilogy, but pales in comparison to the first two films. It has a number of problems. Firstly, the writing and acting were sub-par, especially when considering Sofia Coppola's performance. Secondly, it relies heavily on intertexuality and references to Parts I and II. Also, there's incest, and no one seems to care. Throughout its runtime, it's a fairly decent film. It fails to create as complex of characters and as captivating of an atmosphere‚Ä¶  
6221 Obviously not as good as Parts I & II, but the film had it's moments. And Sofia Coppola is a charisma vacuum in this, what a mistake in casting her.

6223 "Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in"Although The Godfather Part III doesn't ever manage to capture the classical and complex vibe of its predecessors, and further suffers from an unwieldy narrative structure, its elevated due to terrific performances from Andy Garcia alongside Al Pacino, and its fitting conclusion of a well developed central arc. P.S.: Thank God for Al Pacino and Andy Garcia, because this movie may have otherwise been a damp squib. 
6224  A pleasant surprise, despite basically repeating the formula of all the other films based on conspiracies to assassinate Michael Corleone. The film manages to bring good layers to a character that is already very complex and well developed, but it fails to develop the relationships between new and old characters known from the trilogy so well. In this film Michael is already much older, and much more concerned with the well-being of your family and your respective futures. Sofia Coppola‚Ä¶  
6225  I have heard The Godfather Part III described as the same as someone taking a piss on the Mona Lisa.

Just when I thought I was out...They pull me back inPart 3, the delayed closing chapter to the Godfather saga, is framed from the outset as a tragedy. We see, in the first scene, the wrinkles carved across Michael's face, as though made by rivulets of tears. He is aged and infirm, like Vito, his father, in his final days. And, like his father's departing moments, Michael sits in a garden, awash in golden sun, lost in memory. There‚Ä¶

6230  WOW! I'd always heard that The Godfather: Part III was the worst of the trilogy, but until I finally saw it for myself, I had not idea had bad it actually was. Saying a film is the worst of a trilogy doesn't always mean it's a bad film. Obviously when you're talking about a multi-film franchise you aren't going to like or dislike them all on an equal level, but when it comes to The Godfather trilogy, you have the‚Ä¶  
6231  After having watched the first two parts, what I found here was a little disappointing. It's not bad, but it doesn't maintain the level of quality of the previous ones. The story goes back to the same point of family and passing the legacy on to someone else, but now it's Michael Corleone who goes through these dilemmas. It's cool to see how much he was affected by his own actions and the difference in his treatment of family members,‚Ä¶  
6232 okay. sure 
6233 WHAT WAS THE POINT? WHAT WAS THE POINT?! 
6234  The first hour and a half made me wanna get rid of the third disc in my Godfather box set, the last hour and a half barely enticed me into keeping it. The finale is what makes this film feel like it's an important piece of the trilogy, but the action sequences and new characters all feel so out of place that it ruins what could have been another masterpiece. Also, i really felt like this film would've been better‚Ä¶  
6235  I finally did it. I finally did the forbidden, unforgivable task of watching The Godfather Part III. And no, it was not bad at all. But it obviously doesn‚Äôt go anywhere near its predecessors.¬†It‚Äôs just so saddening to think that if this was even remotely close to the first two, this trilogy would probably be known as the greatest of all time. But no. Instead we had to deal with two masterpieces in filmmaking, and a disappointment.¬†I think‚Ä¶  
6236  Now that I got to see Mario Puzo's The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone today, and seeing Coppola's reflection on his flawed masterpiece, the film finally feels like an epilogue; the editing kinda bothers me , but the more focused story really makes up for it.But the altered ending is the bigger and better changes of it, leaving Michael with what he deserved.I don't know what to watch, but personally I would say "go watch the‚Ä¶

Al Pacino looked worse here with the sticked up gray hair in the 90s than he did in 2019 with Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. This is the extra bonus movie we got later.

6245 I remember watching the first two godfather films back in 2012 when I was 8 years old. 3 years later I watched the godfather part 3 back in 2015 and after I watched the film I thought it was alright,and years later the third film grew on me and this movie is such a let down. I thought Francis Ford Coppola waited to long for the sequel and it didn't live up to it's expectations. overall very disappointing. 
6246 I imagined 1000 different ways this whole saga could end.Al Pacino ugly crying with a Mr Rogers sweater and a crew cut, was not one of them.¬†The Godfather Trilogy podcast episode 
6247 this was actually pretty good considering loads of people didn‚Äôt like one. the only thing that i loathed was the two cousins loving each other too too much. it was hella weird. in all togetherness, this was great imo 
6248 A flawed, but still generally-good sequel that doesn't take anything away from the originals, but doesn't add a whole lot to them either. It's worth checking-out after watching the first two but just remember that it could never hope to live up to the standard set by those films after sixteen years.They didn't quite massacre my boy, they just downgraded 'em a tad. 
6249 way too much unnecessary dialogue, a laughably weird incest subplot & a painful number of reaction shots sprinkled throughout till the very ending but i still really liked it. really loved how atmospheric all the Sicily scenes are, so so good. glad that sofia stopped acting & started directing üôèüèΩ amazing trilogy overall but hate how bitter the ending is...need to watch the coda cut asap

6254  I‚Äôve held off for years. First two films are so grandiose & outsized in our ideas of what cinematic epics can be, it‚Äôs hardly fair to read the third as being in that lineage. So I‚Äôve long thought. But that‚Äôs not really it.The Godfather Part III gets to be mediocre all on its own.

6255 Not as bad as its reputation would suggest. Quite good even. The whole opera house sequence, for example, is excellent and a true highlight. Al Pacino's performance is great as well. Story-wise I got lost to be completely honest. It didn't help that I've seen this already because I couldn't remember a thing from it. Besides an helicopter attack. Sofia's performance seems to be the main complaint and I can see why. It's quite bad, and, at best makes you chuckle, and, at worst ruins an otherwise fantastic scene (the ending). I love Lost in Translation thought, so she's forgiven ‚ù§Ô∏è

6258 The Godfather Part III is just as good as the other two parts, and I'm tired of pretending it's not 
6259 Honestly it ain‚Äôt THAT bad, obviously nowhere near the two masterpieces that came before it but still feels like a poetic ending for Michael. Andy Garcia was a pretty good addition aside from the incest storyline. Also got to listen to Nino Rota‚Äôs score again so it‚Äôs a win for me. 
6260 I watched the CODA cut, so I can‚Äôt really comment on how good the original release was, but I didn‚Äôt think it was as bad as its reputation. Part three is definitely less focused than the first two and I didn‚Äôt really care for how much time was spent with Sonny‚Äôs kid, but it was still a decent watch. I can finally understand that Sopranos joke now too! Also, Sofia Coppola has done way too much for my life for me to say anything bad about her performance, so I think she killed it :)

6262 Whoever thought casting Sofia Coppola was a good choice:Big Mistake. Big. Huge. A three star goes for the final act, Siccily scenes, the everlasting magnificence of Diane Keaton, Al Pacino, and Talia Shire, and to a good enough direction from Francis Ford Coppola. Oh yeah, the chemistry between Michael and Kay never ends, it adds up to that bit of enjoyment. Everything else is a big thumbs down.Grade: C+ 
6263  This review is for the new version of the film, aka The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael CorleoneI have only seen The Godfather part III once before, and it was quite a long time ago. So I can‚Äôt really compare the two versions, but I think this one is better for sure. It‚Äôs still CLEARLY the worst one of the trilogy, and it really isn‚Äôt a particularly great or interesting film.¬†I watched this right after rewatching part II,‚Ä¶  
6264 I will fight anyone who talks shit about Sofia Coppola in this. Come at me 
6265 The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael CorleoneDefinitely an improvement over the theatrical release in its pace and momentum of the story. Not much about my opinion on the film has changed. Although I will argue the original ending montage is better. The Godfather trilogy and the story of Michael Corleone might be the greatest tale ever told in Cinematic history.I‚Äôm keeping the score for the film a 7 but for this review I‚Äôm giving it an 8 since I watched the re-edit 
6266 The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone should be a separate option on here 
6267 https://open.spotify.com/track/7e89621JPkKaeDSTQ3avtg?si=bNepW0MLTjW0kb85GsDJhQ 
6268 Nope.This one has me too disappointed to review it properly.Boo hoo 
6269 "I betrayed my wife. I betrayed myself. I've killed men, and I ordered men to be killed. No, it's useless. I killed... I ordered the death of my brother; he injured me. I killed my mother's son. I killed my father's son."This is easily the weakest installment of the film series. It has further proven the importance of good acting in giving justice to a well-composed script. Sofia Coppola, seriously? Overall, it's definitely not in line with the first two films in terms of quality, but it still works as a plausible epilogue to the chaotic Godfather saga. 
6270  1990 - Movie ChartsFrancis Ford Coppola wollte den Film nie Teil 3 nennen. F√ºr ihn war dies ein Epilog zur eigentlichen Geschichte in Teil 1 und 2 und unter diesem Gesichtspunkt diesen Film zu betrachten hilft wirklich ihn besser zu verstehen und milde walten zu lassen.Auch wenn dieser Film aus offensichtlichen Gr√ºnden eher mit Teil 1 verglichen wird, so sind die Elemente aus denen die Handlung zusammen gesetzt ist deutlich √§hnlicher zu dem was Michaels Story in Teil‚Ä¶  
6271  first, the obvious stuff: this movie is not and could never have been on the same level of the first and especially second Godfather films. Those were Coppola working at some of the heights of his powers and by the time 1990 rolled around, the magic just couldn't be recaptured. Second, thankfully Sofia Coppola has emerged as a fantastic film director as she sucks horribly, HORRIBLY as an actress. all that business aside and Godfather III is a clearly rushed‚Ä¶  
6272  This was the first GODFATHER film that felt like a Movie. And by that I mean, not so much a work of art, but a Movie (with a capital M), a total product of modern Hollywood. This is a movie my 8-year old self thought was a big grown-ups movie, and if I'd been an independent adult filmgoer at the time, I'm sure I would have spent a cold Christmas evening luxuriating in the adultness and the lushness of it‚Ä¶  
6273 Nice story about an aging man who is able to win back his wife and kids after reembracing his catholic roots. 
6274  Look... this film is unnecessary and we all know that. I look at THE GODFATHER: PART III in a lot of the same ways I look at EL CAMINO, primarily with the powerful endings of their predecessors. I think there's a certain level of mob mentality towards PART III as on one hand I see people on this site give it a decent score and point out various pros and cons, yet on the other hand, I see a lot‚Ä¶  
6275 Hahahahaha wtf happened???? 
6276 for the things I‚Äôve heard i was expecting this to be horrible but (good news ???) it wasn‚Äôt. it‚Äôs not a bad movie and maybe not even a bad sequel (or not a very bad one) but it surely doesn't live up to its two predecessors 
6277 Fun Fact: Pacino broke his back carrying this movie.‚úÖ80%A-Buy it on Blu-RayFull Price 
6278 When I see Al Pacino's haircut in this : "Look how they massacred my boy" 
6279 I enjoyed this more then I was expecting. I never been fan of the 3 part. But this was good mybe because I saw it at the cinema.¬†The performances were good and the story had me interested. But it‚Äôs not as good as the other 2 films. 
6280 Probably should have never been made. Definitely should have never been made with Sofia Coppola. 
6281  While i don't think Godfather Part III is as bad as some people make it out to be it absolutely suffers from being associated with the first two parts both of whom were so good it'd hard for any third movie to get even close to them. Having said that it also suffers from Coppola's nepotistic decision to cast his daughter as one of the main characters. Al Pacino as well as the rest of the original cast and Andy‚Ä¶  
6282  Full disclosure -- I'm not one of those cinephiles who considers the first two "Godfather" movies to be among the most supremely excellent works of filmic art ever created. The first installment is quite accomplished, I have to acknowledge, but the second tried my patience, and I was put off by Al Pacino's understated performance in Part 2.All that having been said, I'm going to propose another hot take -- Part 3 is actually pretty good. Sure, it has‚Ä¶  
6283 THE GODFATHER CODA: THE DEATH OF MICHAEL CORLEONECoppola said this new Cut gives the movie a new life, I agree. The title suggests this film‚Äôs main focus is concluding Michael‚Äôs story, the theatrical is ambitious but this prioritizes our lead into the tragedy he has befallen and the path for redemption is not one money can buy. 
6284 A certeza de que √© uma obra-prima. 
6285 To be honest, I don't know why I haven't watched the third part until now. I kind of always thought it wasn't a really good film, after all, Part I & II are both absolute masterpieces.But I was wrong. Part III isn't as strong as its two predecessors, but it's still a damn good Mafia film and a worthy (but not perfect) ending to the Corleone saga in my opinion.I'm really looking forward to the new cut of the film, which will be released in December. 
6286 *regarding the announcement of Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone*...just when i thought i was out, they pull me back in 
6287  Forget the convoluted plot, subpar writing and unironic incestuous vibes (incest is nothing new in stories, guys). The biggest crime of this crime drama is that there are no characters! I am never immersed in the drama because all I see are the actors, not the characters they're playing!There's no Michael Corleone, only Al Pacino (that's why the "they pull me back in" quote is infamous, coz it's full-on Pacino)! No Kay, only Diane Keaton! No Don Altobello, only‚Ä¶  
6288  Every girls dream is to star in her dad's 3 hour gangster film where she gets to have an incestuous relationship with her cousin. Duh!For real though, I feel bad for Sofia Coppola. It's hard to chew the scenery and "emote" across the likes of Al Pacino and Diane Keaton, let alone make out with Andy Garcia who is playing your first cousin that you have the grossest hots for. Yikes!Easily the worst of the trilogy, I'm sure‚Ä¶

Also starring Andy Garcia, Diane Keaton and Sofia Coppola.

He decides that his nephew will be the replacement of his empire, however, the mob declines‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs nowhere near the legendary status as the first two, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs as terrible as people make it out to be. It‚Äôs is very messy though. The acting is a bit iffy at‚Ä¶  
6291 O alinhamento assombroso que Coppola encontra entre seus temas e a mise en sc√®ne, aqui mais depurado que nos filmes anteriores, bem como toda a sequ√™ncia final da √≥pera, cuja constru√ß√£o dram√°tica e c√™nica denuncia ao mesmo tempo um rigor matem√°tico e um rebuscamento quase delirante, s√£o o suficiente para me convencer que este √© o meu preferido dos filmes da trilogia. 
6292  The hell with people that bitch about this movie. "They never should have done it" "Sofia sucks" Shuuuuut up! This third installment is almost perfect to me. Michael Corleone trying to buy his way into legitimate business and maybe buy his way into heaven via the Vatican City wheelers and dealers. Garcia is balls out great as Vincent, Sonny's son and Michael's successor. If it wasn't for Pesci competing for the Oscar that year my money was on Andy to‚Ä¶  
6293 Arguably Pacino and Coppola's finest hour. So many great scenes:* Michael's confession to the Cardinal, framed with flowers;* Michael and Kay walking around Sicily and later talking about their past;* Michael convincing his nephew to play the double agent with their enemies (so many layers of truths inside lies and lies inside truths) * Michael makes his nephew the new Don - the more things change...;* The entire sequence at the opera, and that sad finale, maybe the best thing Coppola has ever made;Maybe what disappointed people was a gangster who is old, weak and full of regret?

There's a time you got to go and show you're growing, now you know about the facts of life! The facts of life!

6295 like watching the surviving beatles do a shitty cover of tomorrow never knows 
6296 I actually forgot that I watched this. So I‚Äôm writing this review in the evening when I watched it this morning. I think that says a lot about this. It‚Äôs very forgettable and unnecessary. It‚Äôs not bad it‚Äôs just bland as fuck. It‚Äôs the godfather but without everything interesting. Al Pacino is still good but it doesn‚Äôt feel like Michael Corleone 
6297  The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone VersionI‚Äôm quite surprised I enjoyed this as much as I did. I remember hating it my first go around because of how incredibly different it was compared to the other two. It‚Äôs just too easy to say it doesn‚Äôt live up to the first two but what exactly are we expecting here, for it to be just as good as two of the greatest films of all-time before it? I eased‚Ä¶  
6298 ‚ô´ i like...old movies...like the godfather...three....it's not considered the best one....but that's just me ‚ô´ 
6299  I think watching the trilogy in quick succession definitely impacts how this film reads. I had seen the first, but not the second, and this was my first time with the third. It's *a lot* to take it, no doubt. I found this one the least engaging but not without its qualities. Andy Garcia gives an incredibly charismatic performance (couldn't help but feel he was a mix between Soprano's Christopher + Gilmore Girls Jess...) Unfortunately I couldn't get behind Sofia‚Ä¶  
6300  I really don't understand why people say [The Godfather Part III] is bad. I thought it was a great movie. I can place all three Godfather movies in the same tier without a doubt. Of course, the first movie is slightly better than the second one, and the second movie is slightly better than the third one. But the third one isn't as bad as some people say. It's a perfect end to a perfect trilogy. I only blame myself‚Ä¶

6304  1990 RankedPhysically Owned FilmsWay better than its reputation, The Godfather: Part III is a great film that gets buried under its own flaws. Sofia Coppola's unfortunate performance is distracting and a complete failure considering the pivotal role she plays. The script bounces back and forth from brilliant and cliche driving an uneven tone, but it's also the little misses that add up. Some awful makeup at the worst time, an incest plot line, and a real hole left‚Ä¶  
6305 Haven‚Äôt seen the original cut all the way through, but I just saw the Coda cut all the way through. A man being forced to relive his previous experiences with a soul that feels that pain that comes from his actions. Living with your mistakes. An experience that is the anthesis of your whole life. A world that hates your story and wants you to suffer from your soulless actions. Live with the regret while you can. This movie hates and loves the previous movies. Cinema dammit!!

6314  My feelings towards this movie are summed up by the scene where they try to make a touching moment out of the depressing drawing Anthony made in Part II. Way to miss the point, can't believe it were the same writers.Apparently consensus on this is that it is not as good as the first two but still a good movie. I do not think it is.

6315 Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone EditionFrancis Ford Coppola (Jack, Twixt) re-edits this film with the intention of making it better. He does not succeed. It‚Äôs actually just a little bit worse because with all of the rearranged scenes, it‚Äôs more difficult to know how much running time is left.

6320  ‚òÜ‚ÄùJust when I thought I was out, they pull me back in.‚Äù‚òÜSo it's been a great set of back-to-back-to-back nights seeing all The Godfather films, from the iconic first on New Year's Eve, to the impeccable second part that might be just as perfect, and now we'll finish with Part III, the misunderstood and wrongly maligned conclusion to the epic trilogy.Now now, I am NOT -- well, you already saw the stars I ‚Äúgave‚Äù the film, so no‚Ä¶  
6321  This is not a Godfather movie.I‚Äôve seen the first two films three times each, but this was my first experience with the infamous Part 3. I‚Äôve read several reviews on this app that say this is the perfect addition to the universe, on par story wise with the original, and even a great conclusion for this character. My opinion isn‚Äôt greater than anyone‚Äôs, but my god did we watch the same film?? This feels like the furthest thing from‚Ä¶  
6322 More than Sofia Coppola‚Äôs acting,¬†the bigger enemy of this movie is its convoluted plot!This is a great film individually but sadly in real world, remains in the shadow of its two mind blowing predecessors. 
6323  Francis Ford Coppola‚Äôs Godfather Trilogy is cinema at its finest form. Nothing will ever top the exhilarating feeling I have felt after watching these three films.I do not understand why the Godfather Part III gets so much hate? It‚Äôs better paced than the first two films it‚Äôs (in my opinion) better than Part II and has one of the best endings in cinema.I never thought anything could top Gladiator as my #1 and going into this movie I‚Ä¶  
6324  This was like Creed except Rocky is Michael, Donnie is Vincent, and Adrian is still alive and is Rocky‚Äôs sister...I did it, I finally convinced myself to watch this movie. I gotta admit, it has its moments. But the bad outweighs the good, and the runtime didn‚Äôt help at all.Don‚Äôt get me started on the incestuous relationship between the two new characters (who I am not fond of by the way). What was that for?Notable things I‚Ä¶  
6325 was going to make a joke about young andy garcia being my new best friend but his character is so gross smh 
6326  First time viewing of the Coda Cut. I never had a problem with this film the way that many seem to. Having revisited parts 1 and 2 recently, and feeling rather lukewarm towards them, the obvious reason that part 3 was never this piece of shit in my eyes, was that I didnt hold the others in such high regard. Part 3 was on television a lot back in the 90's and if it was on, I'd usually sit down‚Ä¶  
6327 Again Phenomenal movie incredible way to end greatest movie franchise ever.

6329 well thank god sofia coppola became a director 
6330  The Godfather: Coda...I saw The Godfather: Part III in the theater in 1990 as a Coppola loving seventeen year old. Even then, though I wasn't able to articulate why, I knew there was something off about the film. It's not that it was terrible. It just didn't manage to maintain any of the feel that the first two gave me. It felt like a knock-off. Nor did it seem to fit correctly in the world Coppola had created in‚Ä¶  
6331 Coppola leaning in too hard on the kissing cousins in the commentary relishing in how "naughty" it is and having to sit through so much atrocious Joe Mantegna; why did the superior Joe (Spinell) have to leave us so soon.Very annoying going back to this cut of the film. 
6332 It‚Äôs fine. Not nearly as good as the first 2 but it‚Äôs not terrible. I don‚Äôt know, I didn‚Äôt hate it. I don‚Äôt have much to say.¬†There is one (unrelated) thing I would like to say though.Next watch üëÄ 
6333  Nowhere near the levels of the first two. The story is much harder to parse, with banking secrets, Vatican intrigue, and traitorous dons all blending together in an unclear mix. Scene-to-scene it‚Äôs ok, but the overarching stuff gets a little muddled‚Äîhowever, you can still get a vibe of what‚Äôs going on, so you‚Äôre not totally lost. Andy Garcia is great as Michael Corleone‚Äôs new prot√©g√©e, bringing a lot of charisma to the screen. And look, Sofia Coppola has had years‚Ä¶

6337 Meant to log this when i saw it but couldn't find it then - either way this version hit so much harder than the original and even though i still have big issues with the entire concept of this film I'm taking it for what it is and that's just an incredibly well-made piece of work that shows a different phase in the lives of not just the characters but also the filmmakers. I really enjoyed watching this and I think Coppola did an amazing job re-editing it (especially the end) to make it have more to say, emotionally, with fewer words 
6338  (original cut) Not bad, just not particularly great either. The first two instalments had made me so hungry, and so I savoured this one with a bowl of pasta and a nice Chianti (not just for the quote, I couldn't watch the Godfather with a bottle of French red, could I?!) - and it was a perfectly good night in. My friend and I concurred that the film was rather slow and unclear in character motivation at first, then improved‚Ä¶

6346  The third and final film of Coppola's Godfather series ends with a bang. It holds up really strong within the trilogy and I feel currently is underrated. Before seeing this film I thought this film wouldn't hold up as everybody seems to say that The Godfather Part III is horrible or lackluster. I completely disagreee as I feel this film is incredibly strong. Yes the film doesn't have that feeling of a period film because it isn't. It's more contemporary‚Ä¶  
6347 Although the goal was to recreate the magic of the initial two instalments, the innate aspiration was to mimic the formula that had led to the previous two iterations being unparalleled triumphs; but regrettably, the drive was lacking, the kind of vision necessitated to not surpass but at least measure up to the excellence of this series was absent. 
6348  The Fredo of the trilogy, let‚Äôs be real. Whilst it does have some redeemable aspects, notably Pacino‚Äôs performance and the editing in my view, there‚Äôs not much good that features in The Godfather: Part III. It honestly feels¬†like a Godfather reunion episode, which can‚Äôt help play the theme tune at every moment for the sake of nostalgia, that‚Äôs written by Tommy Wiseau. This is one of the worst scripts I‚Äôve ever had to listen to and endure, with horrible dialogue‚Ä¶  
6349 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   A watched Coppola's new edit, The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone, with a kinder mind than the last time I saw the original version. It made me want to watch the original edit for a side-by-side comparison. Godfather III was always meant as a coda to the first two films, which told a complete story, and Coda benefits from emphasizing that distinction.My new assessment: Sofia is OK but not good, far from the worst Hollywood nepotism case‚Ä¶   
6350  Some may say that the amount of times the word ‚Äúlegitimate‚Äù is said in this movie is enough of a reason to bring it down a half star. Sheesh, Michael, could you be any less of a parrot?¬†Rant time.¬†First off: The Godfather Part III is a screenwriting bomb! The dialogue is concernedly mediocre if not at times genuinely appalling. Examples‚Ä¶‚ÄúHi, Vincent. I remember you.‚Äù ‚Äì MaryWell, considering you know his name, I would assume so‚Ä¶‚ÄúI‚Ä¶  
6351 youtu.be/bzblLkTJJmM 
6352 I mean, it‚Äôs still good I suppose. But not nearly as good as the first two. The story was a little too convoluted and the tone was off. I‚Äôm not sure I liked the ending either.Still, you have a lot of the cast returning, including Al Pacino, who gives a great performance. I liked Andy Garcia as well.I thought Sofia Coppola was horrible. Easily one of the worst parts of the movie. Nepotism at its finest. She‚Äôs redeemed herself though by turning to directing. 
6353 The Corleones, I'll miss you allüò©‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èBest trilogy I've EVER seen. 
6354  It‚Äôs hard to really judge this film after watching the first two because of how legendary they are. This one just couldn‚Äôt hold up against them.We all know about Sofia Coppola‚Äôs infamously bad acting, but it‚Äôs more the fault of her father for putting her in that role to begin with. Then there is the simple fact that an incestuous relationship isn‚Äôt going to play well no matter what the reason. I also found the storyline to be very‚Ä¶  
6355  So I watched the original cut of the much less loved conclusion to Michael Corleone's story before the re-edited version, just to get an idea of what disappointed everyone. Sure you can note some similarities to the first movie in the way Michael's story is structured. There's a party scene that establishes the current situation of the family and the movie's conflicts and there's even a point where Michael ends up weak in a hospital while a young person steps‚Ä¶  
6356 sofia coppola <3it might be hard to believe but, unfortunately (or fortunately), i don't have much to say about this film.....i loved Sofia Coppola, like why on earth everyone bullied her saying she couldn't act???? stoooop! anyways, i just don't understand why this film was even made in the first place:/ not bad, but also compared to the previous films is just............especially the ending!! it was slightly goofy vibes mixed with me feeling extremely emotional, because what was the reason ?????? 
6357  And here we are with what is possibly for most people, the biggest cinematic trilogy let down ever committed to film, not necessarily a sentiment I would add my voice to the chorus of but nonetheless I can understand this disquiet over this much maligned third part of The Godfather trilogy, the animosity felt towards this film and the furore kicked up by it's shortcomings back upon release is well documented, I think in response to it the cast and‚Ä¶  
6358 CODALarge improvements. Better beginning and pacing but the ending, while better in some ways, clips some additional footage that would have served the film better. Frustrating that it almost almost stuck the landing but didn't, and you know the content was there.

6360 Sofia Coppola‚Äòs acting is incredibly awful, and I am so glad she went on to direct movies instead. 
6361 Upon this rewatch, it‚Äôs not terrible in the way my kind keeps thinking it is when I think about it. It‚Äôs just when you compare it to Part 1 & 2, it isn‚Äôt as good. But it‚Äôs still a pretty good movie. But also doesn‚Äôt quite have the same feeling that both Part 1 & 2 give. 
6362  So I caved sooner than I thought I would and subjected myself to Part III. I approached this film with as open a mind as one could possibly have. Rota‚Äôs main theme never fails to hold your attention at gunpoint, and the ominous tracking through the dilapidated state of the Corleone‚Äôs Nevada residence was a killer opening to pick up Part II‚Äôs engulfing darkness right where we left off. Shortly after, however, Part III¬†loses most of what made its predecessors‚Ä¶  
6363  Watched the Coda cut.Not as bad as I remembered. A lot of good stuff here that deserve credit. However everything to do with Sofia Coppola made me physically cringe. If Winona Ryder went through with the role and the incest subplot got cut, this film would be significantly better since the emotions rely on Mary Corleone so much.The first time I watched this, I didn't have the eye for cinematography as I do now so I really appreciated‚Ä¶  
6364 sofia baby PLEASE just think about this 
6365 [Mario Puzo's The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone edition]I've seen the original cut of TGIII three or four times but not for a minute. I remember the last time thinking, "This is pretty flabby." However, while watching the new cut I thought, "This is pretty taut." I can't really distinguish what was cut though. I would love to see a "Before Sunrise" edit where it's just Michael and Kay walking around Sicily for a day and talking about their lives and love. 
6366  ‚ÄúJust as I thought I was out, they pull me back in!‚Äù Well, The Godfather Part III is exactly what I expected it to be. It was a disappointing conclusion to a trilogy that could have been named the best of all time. Today was a confusing day and this film was is one of the reasons why. This wasn't a necessary movie. I wouldn't say it ruined the previous films for me but it did lower my score a‚Ä¶  
6367  Watched on Blu-Ray Francis Ford Coppola had not actually intended to make a third film about the Corleone story, as he felt that the story was finished with the end of the second part, but a series of commercial failures in the 1980s forced him to take another look at Michael Corleone and his relatives. Coppola was not really satisfied with the final result, even though "The Godfather Part III" received positive reviews, he wanted to film the script version‚Ä¶  
6368  Watched: Coda - The Death of Michael Corleone.Seemingly produced to rectify three key issues that FFC had always had a problem with that I oddly didn't, this remains a single watch curio, like the Alien Directors Cut, never to replace the original and superior version in my future viewing history.While ten minutes shorter than the original version, the key changes are that change in title (apparently being sold as The Godfather Part III was putting too much pressure‚Ä¶

6370  "i betrayed myself"i finished it! i finished it, mom! i finished it, dad! can i call myself a true cinephile now? lol like bojack horseman said: "...it‚Äôs fine. it‚Äôs fine. i mean, it‚Äôs not fine but, you know, it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ fine". what's not fine was sofia coppola's dreadful acting. thankfully, she moved to a better profession ‚Äî directing (tho i cannot say i'm a fan, i haven't seen much of her work). sadly, that's not the only bad thing in‚Ä¶  
6371 It‚Äôs good for all of us that Sofia Coppola decided to become a director rather than stick to acting 
6372 Watched the Coda re-edit.Fantastic, novelesque. Thrilled that I never had to see the "bad" version.What lucky timing to finally decide to watch the trilogy. 
6373  Yeah, it stands a little pale compared to the first two. I thought it nailed the ending though, which I guess was the most important thing for this film to achieve, even if it did feel a little rushed. It was a pretty tense and emotionally painful final 30 minutes or so to watch. The overarching story of this trilogy was definately a lot more tragic than I was expecting too, and all the better so. And while this film‚Ä¶

6376  La m√°s floja de la trilog√≠a pero su aire intimista y como Michael y su familia van cayendo en pedazos hace que no pueda odiar esta pel√≠cula. Su final a mi me fascina, ese grito primero vac√≠o y luego ruidoso de Michael que estuvo toda la pel√≠cula lidiando con su culpa, con su pasado, con todo lo que lo llev√≥ a estar en la cima de la mafia para proteger a su familia y que ir√≥nicamente termin√≥, posteriormente en perder‚Ä¶

6381  THE GODFATHER, CODA: THE DEATH OF MICHAEL CORLEONEA beautiful recut of Coppola's coda to the story of the Corleone family. The great strength of the new cut is that it really focuses the thematic core to be more about Michael seeking redemption for him and his family as he rots away from the inside after a lifetime of moral transgression. This is so much more compelling than the primary theme of the theatrical cut being this idea of levels‚Ä¶  
6382  The one strength of this misguided and difficult film is it's ending. That Michael is forced to actually experience grief as a man for the first time since he entered into his father's business. He doesn't get vengeance, he doesn't get even, he suffers. It's a poetic end.The problem is everywhere else. Everything is a shadow of what came before. I think the core behind a lot of the film's failings comes in it's release. The film takes place‚Ä¶

Power, wealth and his conscience that refuses to give in to injustice and corruption. The film offers a deep look into the world of organized crime‚Ä¶

6392 Watched The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael CorleoneIt's definitely better than I initially gave it credit for. There are definitely a handful of amazing scenes and performances that make the movie well worth a watch. The set-pieces are, by and large, excellent, while Michael's confession is a touching piece of drama. Coppola more generally directs with the conviction and dignity you'd want from a Godfather sequel and the tinkering he makes in the new cut is largely a benefit. But the movie amounts to less than the sum of its parts.More to come.

6395  Following my rewatch of The Godfather Parts I & II I finally pressed play on the final chapter of the franchise. I‚Äôd heard it wasn‚Äôt even worth watching, didn‚Äôt do the first two movies justice, etc. but it was a solid part three! Maybe one of the most complete, succinct trilogies I‚Äôve ever seen! People are haters. I liked watching Michael start to reap what he‚Äôs sewn in a life of organized crime, although it‚Äôs difficult to see his family fall‚Ä¶

6401  The story is really good and works excellently as a coda. However, there are moments that can be described as excessive‚Äîthere‚Äôs a lot less restraint here in terms of thematic emphasis and interpersonal connections. Some of the relationships are highly questionable and the end result is rather overbearing. The operatic approach is pretty cool, but it doesn‚Äôt fit so well with the tone of the other films.¬†The acting in general is a major step down from the heights of‚Ä¶  
6402  The biggest problem that The Godfather Part III has always had is that it isn't parts I and II. It always has been an excellent picture, if not quite the medium redefining masterpiece of either of its predecessors. Then again, maybe it was never fair to expect that of it. It's an excellent film and that is its greatest problem, although Sofia Coppola's performance and how it was regarded never helped either. Its new version, now known as The Godfather‚Ä¶  
6403  Original cutCoppola hit it big in the 70s with the first two films. I don‚Äôt think it was possible for this film to life up to its predecessors. And it‚Äôs sad when a film‚Äôs negative reputation exceeds the product itself. This film is may not be perfect but it‚Äôs a fitting conclusion to quite possibly the greatest multi film storyline ever put to film. And can you really blame Sofia Coppola? She was very reluctant to take on the‚Ä¶  
6404  (I guess we're just filing these THE GODFATHER CODA: THE DEATH OF MICHAEL CORLEONE under PART III?)Here's one thing Coppola's re-edit drastically improves: all of the Vatican intrigue. The actual *plot* of the film feels much clearer now than it did in the past. Here's one thing it *can't* do: Make the central, agonizing loss of the film resonate more strongly by replacing the actress who represents that loss. I don't blame Sofia Coppola for being bad in this‚Ä¶  
6405  honestly i don‚Äôt understand why this epilogue for the godfather films is so undervalued. maybe because it‚Äôs too harsh, or because it seems to strip the past films characters from some of their glory, like a counter argument that‚Äôs just too strong and easier to ignore. unlike the other ones this one is very much the opposite of exciting as the story only gets increasingly tragic and the ending is just the last nail in the coffin.this film focus‚Ä¶  
6406  "he's your  first  cousin."  "then i'll love him first" -an actual quote from the godfather part iiithis movie is hot garbage and it makes me sad :((from the incest to sofia coppola's acting, i cannot stand this film. 
6407 COVID-19. Self-quarantine movie watch #255.This one isn't great as the last two ones but I still enjoyed it and the story was cool.Andy Garcia is probably the best thing out of this movie! He is hot in this too.P.S üò©üò©I finally finished this goddamn trilogy so that my dad can stop saying that I can't judge movies without seeing this trilogy. üò´üò´ And holy fuck I'm exhausted. 
6408  Honestly, The Godfather: Part III was doomed from the very start. Not only did this release almost two whole decades after the masterpiece that is the second chapter in this trilogy that released in 1974 but nothing about it ever feels like it's essential to the story at all, never really feeling like it adds much of anything to the Corleone family or this world in any significant way. Al Pacino does his best with the material he's given and‚Ä¶  
6409  This is a very good comedy movie and a very bad end to the Godfather trilogy. If you want a movie to watch to drink to and make fun of put this in the rotation. Somewhere between Godfather 2 and 3 Pacino went from serious actor to cartoon Pacino. If this wasn't almost 3 hours long I could almost excuse it but, being in the rare position of having watched all 3 Godfather movies¬†in a marathon without breaks I can‚Ä¶  
6410  While rewatching Francis Ford Coppola‚Äôs seminal¬†Godfather Trilogy I‚Äôve been struck by how deeply it dwells within the same contrast of gang violence and Catholicism that Martin Scorsese is known for. Part III is the most substantive on that front, not just in the way it weaves its fictional tale into the real-life rumours and workings of the church at the time, but in compelling visual details: Connie and Vincent planning murder in a hospital chapel; a statue of the Virgin‚Ä¶  
6411  It has a semi-decent ending, but it's mostly because it uses the theme from Raging Bull and conspicuously evokes memories of an infinitely better movie. The whole thing feels like an amateur student film daring to continue the narrative that just so happens to have the exact same cast and crew. I admire that a good deal of thought probably went into this, but the fact that the arc of Part II is somewhat nullified doesn't do it any favors,‚Ä¶  
6412 Awesome ending, awesome lines but the movie itself, the biggest MEH if ever there was one. 
6413 i mean its not a bad film but its a bad godfather film.compared to the first two films this is disrespectful 
6414 First time watching the "Death of Michael Corleone" cut, which is indeed a bit better than the original theatrical, though for the most part what I wrote in my Dissolve review is still true: visually splendid but a near complete botch in terms of dialogue, performance, place-setting and story. thedissolve.com/reviews/788-the-godfather-part-iii/ 
6415  Since I had seen (and adored) the new cut of The Godfather: Part III back in April, I decided to check out the theatrical version of the film for this rewatch. The film definitely has more sluggish pacing compared to that tighter cut, but boy oh boy is it still absolutely incredible from beginning to end! It's so intricate, so brilliantly put together, and rooted in tragedy. I think I will definitely watch the whole trilogy together from now on,‚Ä¶  
6416 Really wanted to like it a lot more. Not terrible but not as good as the other two. That ending though... now that was good 
6417 I had HOPES. Life would be meaningless without them. I thought Francis is going to give us a Christmas miracle. The Photography is as good as the others, the music, the production design, the bad script, the bad acting OH the cruelty of having your HOPES dashed.See for yourself, ask yourself- How bad could it be? 
6418 Andy Garcia‚Äôs Vincent Mancini becoming The Godfather is the equivalent of Shia LaBeouf‚Äôs Mutt Williams donning Indy‚Äôs fedora in Krystal Skull (thank god he didn‚Äôt!)

I won't go and say that I didn't like The Godfather Part III, but this is not at the same level as the other two, there was a‚Ä¶  
6423 People kissing Andy Garcia‚Äôs hand and calling him ‚ÄúDon Corleone‚Äù might be the worst moment in cinema history.

6425 ‚ÄúWhen the Sicilians wish you Cent'anni, it means for long life‚Ä¶ and a Sicilian never forgets,‚Äù 
6426 comparando ele com o primeiro filme nem esse √© nem o segundo chega perto, mas eu gostei bastante desse a √∫nica coisa que eu n√£o gostei foi o casal de primos, mas n√£o me incomodou tanto e acho que a melhor parte s√£o os minutos finais, s√£o super tensos e o final super triste. 
6427 Part 3 was surprisingly pretty good despite what I've heard. You know what isn't and is absolutely disgusting? That scene where Sofia Coppola handles food with her cousin without washing her hands. Nasty, they should be ashamed. Oh and the incest was pretty bad too. 
6428 after reading everyone‚Äôs reviews, I was preparing myself for the worst like some kind of disgrace to the trilogy, but um‚Ä¶ this was perfectly fine! I mean¬†was this movie necessary? no maybe not, but was it still enjoyable? hell yeah!! 
6429 Every time I rewatch this, I think that it might magically be good this time around. It never is and will always suck. But, if this movie was never made and never made all that money, I don‚Äôt think 1992‚Äôs Dracula would exist. Dracula is right up there with the best of Coppola. So, I guess Godfather 3 does serve some other purpose than completely letting down everyone who enjoys this series or anybody else who appreciates film.

I can handle the truth.   ‚ÄúI swear, on the lives of my children: Give me a chance to redeem myself, and I will sin, no more‚Äù/ ‚ÄúJuro, por la vida de mis hijos: dame la oportunidad de redimirme y no volver√© a pecar‚ÄùI had not seen it in its entirety since its premiere at the Cineteca Nacional in Mexico City, accompanied by my parents.

6431  "Never hate your enemies. It affects your judgment."I decided to check out the alternate cut, CODA: THE DEATH OF MICHAEL CORLEONE, and...yeah, it's still not a very good movie.To be clear, I don't think this is an egregious film as some make it out to be. I don't think it tarnishes the entire legacy of the saga, nor does Sofia Coppola deserve all the flack that she has always gotten. In fact, there's a lot of good stuff‚Ä¶  
6432 Every family has bad memoriesJaw dropped at this ending. Can't think of a better or more punishing end than a gunshot to unleash all the horrors of this series, encapsulated in a moment of evicerating pain (Michael and Kay screaming real terror into the air, suddenly death is real.) All the ghosts of those you loved and lost return in your final moments to ask "what was it all for?" Don't dread me anymore 
6433 Not having seen the other 2, and experiencing my manic recaps of the movies after I had revisited them at the cinema, Steph came along for the lolz.Although she found Al "very attractive" she fell peepies and thought his sister was his second wife, (i quickly explain about the extra first wife in Sicily) which like that wouldn't be weird in this cause the cousins were fucking. 
6434 Less of a trilogy closer and more of an extended epilogue. Much of the mafia maneuvering feels like an afterthought, though the big set pieces still sing (heh) and the interweaving of the mob with the Vatican is key, tying everything back to the real heart of the matter: the lingering grief and regret whittling Michael down to a human being who is able to be hurt again. Slacker and more stilted than its impeccable predecessors, sure, but when it works, it fires on all cylinders. I don't expect to forget the ending anytime soon. 
6435  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs your first cousin!‚Äù‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll love him first...‚ÄùI still refuse to believe that this line was said. Sofia‚Äôs acting is not good but not too awful like how some have claimed it to be. Some parts just felt unimportant although you can‚Äôt deny that its still technically well-made.

6439 Theatrical CutI liked and admired what Coppola was going for, it‚Äôs easily inferior to 1 & 2 but separates itself managing to stick out (for better or worse) from a trilogy that is known for some of the best filmmaking ever. I‚Äôm excited to see the new cut since supposedly they fix stuff, but overall good film, doesn‚Äôt deserve the hate. 
6440 THE GODFATHER CODA: THE DEATH OF MICHAEL CORLEONEPeople were too hard on Sofia. The film‚Äôs only real flaw is that George Hamilton is nowhere near a sufficient replacement for Robert Duvall. 
6441 Coda: The Death of Michael Corleonein many ways this film seems to be equating big business, organized religion and even...crime?I had never seen the third Godfather film and this new cut seemed like the perfect chance to dive in. What a SPECTACULAR and tragic conclusion to the Corleone family. 
6442  Thank God this is actually something you can log on this site. Letterboxd should do this for more Director‚Äôs Cuts, aside from just this and the SnyderCut.Anyways this new cut of the third Godfather film doesn‚Äôt, to my slight disappointment, raise the material to the same level as the first two films, however I think this time the disappointment isn‚Äôt nearly as bad and that‚Äôs in part to the name change. I think we as cinema goers often overlook‚Ä¶  
6443 goddamnit 
6444  The essence of the first 2 films are gone. The spirit of Godfather 1 & 2 are gone. It looks like a typical gangster mob drama. Michael Corleone's character has changed, unlike in the first 2 films. The intensity of the first 2 films are gone. But the design is still great and all technical aspects. The acting in the film is just felt different from the first two films. I can't help but to compare because this is a third‚Ä¶  
6445 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   The Godfather Part III is formed entirely around the assumption that we want Michael Corleone's story to have a happy ending tacked onto it. In a sense, Michael's ending isn't happy--he loses pretty much everyone near and dear to him. The problem is that this already happened at the end of Part II. There was no need for this third film except to redeem Michael's character. When he dies at the end of this film, he's not the ruthless, heartless‚Ä¶   
6446 The acting is good and the story is partially interesting, but the pacing is so off, The Godfather: Part III is too slow and it really hurts the film. The first two films were enough. 
6447 The Godfather is a cult Film for ever¬†The Godfather part 2 its Magnificent¬†The Godfather part 3 its meg lazy üòî 
6448 Took me two years to watch part 3 and honestly it wasn‚Äôt as bad as what everyone makes it out to be. The entire opera performance and the deaths happening simultaneously and what follows after that was honestly kinda genius. I love her films now but Sofia Coppola had the emotional range of a rock. 
6449 O resultado finalizado, agrada e desagrada, toda atmosfera criada com os antecessores continua vigente, mas com menos impacto, mas n√£o deixa de ser uma obra excelente e com o grande poder e teor do cinema. 
6450 Not a bad film but it's pretty weak because of it‚Äôs narrative and it doesn't have the vibe that the first two had so that makes this Part III, unfortunately, a disappointment. 
6451 Al Pacino should of won an Oscar for The Godfather Part 2 
6452  Ich glaube, mehr als 15 Jahre habe ich gebraucht, um endlich mal die finale Motivation aufzubringen, Teil 3 anzuschauen.Ich bin allerdings sehr zufrieden mit dem Film, auch wenn sich Teil 3, wie erwartet, nicht mit seinen Vorg√§ngern messen kann.Einige Szenen erinnern schon recht stark an die vorigen Teile (wenn ich dar√ºber nachdenke, dann sind alle "Der Pate"-Filme √§hnlich konzipiert).Oft liegt der Fokus auf Michael Corleone's Vergangenheit: es werden Schaupl√§tze der Vorg√§nger besucht, Konflikte nochmal angesprochen usw.. Das‚Ä¶  
6453 Junior Varsity compared to the first two for sure, but it's not unwatchable. I mean besides Sofia Coppola who seems to be in a different movie. I really do love this crime world Francis Ford Coppola has created and I'm always pleased to enter it, but this one is certainly lacking. 
6454 "The Godfather Part III" definitely does not hold up compared to the previous two beautiful works of art, but man is it a well done film. 
6455  Last night after the Super Bowl I had the free time to watch a long film so it was the time for me to rewatch a movie I had seen before but the last time was years ago. Some movies come off as worse after the passage of time or are seen as worse by me compared to when I saw it in my youth. Likewise, films can be better due to the passage of time. This is a movie‚Ä¶  
6456  Mary Corleone: ¬´I'll always love you.¬ªVincent Mancini: ¬´Love somebody else.¬ª- Coppola delivers a ¬´How-to¬ª in painful dialogue writing.I recently watched Trail of the Pink Panther, and it's really tempting to name this one Trail of the Godfather. It would be somewhat rude to do so, because there are bits and pieces of good filmmaking hidden in here. Nevertheless it feels just as unsatisfying as the former film, like it lacks the main character.All sequels has to‚Ä¶  
6457  Of course this is no where near as phenomenal as it's predecessors, but it's was hard enough making gold strike twice. Did you really think they can make it strike a third time? Sure this has evident flaws everyone jabs at this film (Sofia Coppola's wooden acting for starters) and this does'nt grab you and pull you back in like the last two, but if you allow yourself to simply watch a family you've come to love through two films‚Ä¶  
6458 Sofia COPPOLA was unmatched in her performance. Take that as you will. Lol

Think as big as drama can go; beyond the operatic. A level of‚Ä¶  
6460  85/100Mario Puzo's The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone Although I always had my reasons as to why I've always said The Godfather Part III doesn't measure up to the first two masterpieces, this Coda doesn't add to the legacy of the trilogy, nor to the legacy of the third film. This is merely a project that provides some closure for Coppola after 30 years of not having been able to execute the vision he had in mind‚Ä¶  
6461 not entirely sure why this threequel is so maligned. i guess people were either expecting a timeless classic like the previous two (which this doesn't try to be) or a cool and slick gangster movie like Goodfellas, which premiered three months prior. regardless, all of the usual critiques didn't bother me much. the romance was fine and garc√≠a was good (so was copolla, btw), the plot wasn't as complex as the other two, contrary to the complaint that it's convoluted, and what really shone was pacino's performance as michael. it's a very depressing epic, one that neatly compliments the narrative of the series. 
6462 Meh.The worst part of the movie by far is Sophia Coppolas performance. The best part is when she dies.Meh.One of the many problems with this movie is that fact that 90% of the scenes have ADR. And 100% of the ADR is laugh out loud horrible.Meh. 
6463 Unlike part two, I don't think this one can stand on its own. But overall, it is a decent film and I enjoyed it.

On one side, I have to commend Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo for having guts to continue the Godfather legacy after so many years of leaving audiences perplexed at the end of Part II. But then, you watch the final product, and‚Ä¶  
6465 Uggghhhhhhhhhhh... After a lifetime of denial, I finally took the plunge, and a big wet noodle plunge it was. I don't want to be too down on the film, because the great Gordon Willis still shot a mean picture, and the fleeting eruptions of violence are chillingly well done, but still, it should not exist, and I will continue to live as if I never saw it... yet that last shot is branded into my scalp like a Holocaust tattoo. The loudest, smelliest fart, that last shot.

6472  The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael CorleoneI love how Coppola views his Godfather movies, perfectly describing parts 1 and 2 as the full story and tragedy of the Corleone family, meanwhile part 3 is the epilogue. The end of Part 2 in which Michael legitimately kills one of his own family members hangs over this movie like a dark cloud that won‚Äôt escape. Despite the fact that Michael has turned the family business mostly legit and is on‚Ä¶  
6473 The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone (2020) Francis Coppola revisits Godfather III but doesn‚Äôt change much except the order of some scenes. It‚Äôs still a better movie than it was given credit for being, and Sofia Coppola is notably better than she was condemned for being. It‚Äôs not a great film by any means, but it‚Äôs not too shabby. 
6474  (The Godfather Coda from the 4K Ultra HD Trilogy Collection)A tighter version of the original because of much needed narrative clarity provided by opening with the Vatican scene which originally appeared around 40 minutes in. But also a less emotionally impactful version because of the strange decision to change the ending which I thought was perfect. The perfect world would be the Coda version with the ending of the original. It was hard to tell what was changed besides‚Ä¶  
6475 First time with the theatrical cut and yeah, no matter the version, this is my favorite entry in the trilogy. Sure it's not a perfect film like the first two, but that's part of the charm for me. 
6476 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  What did this achieve? Aside from showing us how Michael dies, this movie adds basically nothing to the already perfect saga of The Godfather. Narratively, this has absolutely no reason to exist.But listen.¬†The movie in itself isn‚Äôt THAT bad, it‚Äôs (mostly) decently acted, shot competently, directed competently and scored pretty well. It‚Äôs just such a shame that such a mediocre movie had to end off what would have been a perfect saga.3/5  
6477 michael deserved a better ending then what ever the fuck that was....its wasn‚Äôt a BAD movie itself but like compared to the other ones it kinda sucked :( i liked the scenes where michael showed kay around Corleone, Sicily tho and i LOVED the flashback scenes :( 
6478 Alright, this is one of those movies that years will pass without watching and I‚Äôll think to myself, ‚Äúyou know what...it‚Äôs not that bad.‚Äù And it‚Äôs not, but it‚Äôs not great. There are definitely parts that are glaringly bad, but there is some good stuff too. I finally checked out The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone and found it to be slightly better than the original cut, but not significantly. 
6479  Part 3 has some of the best moments in the series, namely the confession scene and honestly all of the last 45 minutes, but¬†man there‚Äôs a lot of dull and uninteresting parts in this movie. It also has the painfully awkward and weird incest subplot that has no business being here. Everybody knows that Sofia Coppola was pretty bad in this movie, and while Pacino was good I didn‚Äôt really feel like I was watching Michael Corleone at times. None‚Ä¶  
6480  Alright I put this off wayy longer than I should've, and I don't blame myself.It's not actually a bad film. It's actually a decent film, but compared to its prequels, it seems worse than it is. I feel like every element, which made the first two films so great, was just a bit weaker (apart from the soundtrack - that still slapped!); and this must've had an impact on the whole picture.

6482  watched the CODA cut...for the record, I‚Äôve never had a problem with Sofia. her flat monotone and Valley Girl mien effectively convey what the Corleone name looks like circa 1980: moneyed, privileged, Americanized.¬†the initial problems I had with this movie were 1) the impenetrability of some of the plot elements (like the ‚ÄúImmobiliare,‚Äù a vaguely defined MacGuffin corporation); and 2) what I thought was some inconsistent, uncharacteristic behavior by some of the principles.the CODA cut is a little‚Ä¶  
6483  [coda: the death of michael corleone cut]this movie is good. very, very, good, in fact. and, at least as far as i understand it, it's not entirely attributable to the re-edit. i would not be surprised that a film as depressed and dour as this one was not received the way it deserved upon release.obviously, each film opens with a celebration paired with backroom dealings and conversations but it's fascinating how, with each successive entry, the celebration becomes‚Ä¶  
6484 The Godfather Coda: The death of Michael CorleoneThis slightly trimmed down version has better pacing. The new beginning gives the narrative and plot a more grounded feel, which allows everything that stems from it to feel more coherent.

6486  **spoilers**A review of The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone (2020)The word is not better. It is just an acceptable cut. Coda started with a different opening act giving a notable tonal shift to the film. We witness an old Michael Corleone doing business with The Vatican, there's a vision that he wanted to leave a legacy and the intention of legitimizing the family business. With rearranged scenes, Coda finally pulled its shit together and Michael Corleone's‚Ä¶  
6487 Firstly I‚Äôll always defend Sofia Coppola in this . Yes she isn‚Äôt great but she isn‚Äôt anywhere near as bad as the garbage she has copped the last 30 years . One thing she brings that Winona Ryder wouldn‚Äôt is a young fresh innocent unknown face that kind of works .¬†I‚Äôll have to have a look at the original cut because apart from one huge difference at the end I didn‚Äôt see much of a difference. There was a message from Coppola at the beginning and he did say it was edited differently. 
6488 Mmmm This film is decent becouse somehow had to finish this incredible film.But no one expected another film to be made by continuing the Godfather II.Finally this film it‚Äôs a little sad, how can be possible finish with the history... And Sr. Coppola did the best he could do.Not to be criticized because this last film has been a bit more loose, instead we have to adore him for to do one of the best triology of whole history.In my opinion... THE GODFATHER THE BEST TRIOLOGY EVER MADE 
6489  ~very light spoilers~for being so critically and popularly panned it resulted in the end of an acting career, i would have expected sofia coppola's performance to be on par with tommy wiseau in the room. maybe i'm biased because i'm a huge fan of her directorial work, but was this performance really THAT bad? or is it just because she had to act opposite of AL PACINO and the later hate bandwagon? anyways, glad she left behind a career‚Ä¶  
6490 ¬´ Never hate your enemies, it affects your judgement ¬ªImagine getting killed with your own pair of glasses.... i lol everytime 
6491 It‚Äôs fine but disappointing 
6492 it's a shame really. the movie is full of useless plot lines, uninteresting new characters and really lacks the soul and the spirit of its predecessors. still there are too many good scenes in this movie to be considered a bad film. 
6493  The Fall from Grace.I was getting irritable after watching the previous two Godfather's back to back but just when I thought I was out, they pulled me back in.Part III ends one of the most impressive trilogies of all time with a flawed dip in quality.As a stand-alone film, it's not bad - but it has two of the greatest masterpieces of all time to follow up.Ending one of the most immensely depressing sagas in cinema,‚Ä¶  
6494  Yes, it‚Äôs easily the weakest of the trilogy. It lacks the emotional depth & pace of the first two. Several characters aren‚Äôt given much to do. It‚Äôs mostly uneven. BUT because of Pacino, Garcia, Shire & Keaton towering performances. Sofia Coppola‚Äôs (though she‚Äôs not very fit as actor, thankfully she took her best talent as a director) beauty & Bridget Fonda (who was the Margot Robbie of the 90s, well, a lot of others were but she was one of my favorite hotties‚Ä¶  
6495  Gets an unfair amount of shit for not being as good as Part I and Part II. On the other hand, it trades extensively and desperately on our knowledge of and love for Part I and Part II, so it really does bring a lot of that pain on itself. Stranger in its narrative focus than the other two (a real estate thriller involving a plot to kill the Pope? Sure, why not), but that carries with it an appeal‚Ä¶  
6496  The Godfather: Part III is quite different from the first two movies. In a way, it feels like it's not a part of the trilogy, but Al Pacino's phenomenal performance makes this a worthy addition. I am serious when I say that I'm very impressed by him here, maybe his best performance of the 3?For the first half or so, this is an excellent movie, with an interesting story, some good new characters and although it's still "The Godfather"‚Ä¶  
6497 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Although a disappointment when compared to its two predecessors, the third instalment isn't THAT bad. Considering it was made almost 20 years after the first two, of course the film suffers from the fact that several actors did not reprise their role; Al Pacino does however, returning as Michael Corleone. The film is set years after Part 2, Michael (Al Pacino) has aged and still dons the role of boss of the family. He is now, however, coming to the‚Ä¶   
6498  I went into this with extremely low expectations. Now i cant say that ive heard from people that it was shit, i do remember people saying that this was disposable.

6501 Best one in the trilogy FIGHT ME 
6502  First time watching in over a decade, and my thoughts are relatively the same. This isn't a bad movie at all, it's just not nearly as good as the first two. While the previous two movies are also somewhat episodic because of the long stretches in time, Part III does feel a little more disjointed with a first half set primarily in New York, and the second in Sicily. There are definitely through lines to connect them, but for the‚Ä¶

Seeing this directly after my first adult re-watch of the first two films, I think it's pretty damn good. I'll admit to getting a bit confused at times with the plot,‚Ä¶  
6504 Theatrical CutI truly don't understand why this film is so hated, it doesn't come anywhere close to the first two films but it's still a solid piece of cinema.

6507  The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone Personally my biggest gripe with this is the casting and at times the look. Sofia should never have been cast, though she does look the part and I'm not a big fan of Andy Garc√≠a or Joe Mantegna here. Despite the two latter being decent enough actors I never though they fit this film and their performances weren't up to the standard of the previous. Garcia seems to do what is a‚Ä¶  
6508 [The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone]still one of the very greatest films ever made; could say more but as with when I first saw part III this movie makes me an emotional wreck to such a degree that I can't remember any of the thoughts I was having before it ended and if I do remember I just don't feel like writing them down any time soon 
6509  I don‚Äôt know why it took me so long to watch this movie, but now I finally have, and it was better than I thought it would be. Sure it‚Äôs not a masterpiece like the other 2, but this movie is still good. It‚Äôs a more reflective movie, and I like it for that reason. Andy Garcia is just the best part of this movie, and every time he was on screen I knew something exciting was going to happen.‚Ä¶

6511  A great end to a spectacular trilogy. The Godfather movies are the epitome of crime movies. The portrayal of Mafia life in these movies is just so absorbing and realistic. And this third movie might not have been the best, but a little dip in quality can be expected and tolerated for such movie franchises.

6523 "You gotta kiss your relatives!"-Sofia Coppola Can not for the life of me tell you what this was about, but I always heard this was really political and bad. There's alot of priests and incest in this movie. There's an entire subplot devoted to the catholic church being worried about a scandal breaking out. Can't remember which specific one they were concerned about but it doesn't really matter or go anywhere in the long run. I enjoyed it for what it was, it's just misunderstood.

Die letzten 30 Minuten des Films hatte ich glaub ich 200 Herzschl√§ge pro Minute, weil ich die ganze Zeit abgewartet habe, dass endlich ein Schuss fiel, der aber nie kam.

6529 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   It‚Äôs alright. It just can‚Äôt compare to the first two. Some things couldn‚Äôt be changed, such as Sofia Coppola‚Äôs poor performance, and Robert Duvall still not returning as Tom Hagen. The unnecessary plot point of Mary and Vincent‚Äôs incestuous relationship does not work well. There‚Äôs scenes that feel out of place. A helicopter attack is not very godfather-esque in my opinion with one random guy whining about his ‚Äúlucky coat.‚Äù Weird. Honestly, I couldn‚Äôt point out any significant changes because‚Ä¶   
6530  This is comparable to season 8 of 'Game of Thrones.' What in the fuck is with the casual incest? This is such a desperate installation that somehow, miraculously, got almost every original cast member (whose character wasn't killed yet) to come back for this dumpster fire. Extra creepy to note that the subject of the incestuous relationship was none other than the daughter of the director, who clearly had the role tailor-made to put her in the spotlight despite the‚Ä¶  
6531 Apparently Madonna was one of the many actresses considered for the role of Mary Corleone, only for it to be decided that she was too old. I can say with absolute certainty that this would have been a better film had she been cast. Compared to the previous two films, The Godfather Part III has a real lack of interesting supporting characters, and it makes the lacklustre plot really drag. It really makes you miss the glory days with Clemenza. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a bad film, I just think it‚Äôs comparatively bad when you look at the series as a whole. 
6532  Review of The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone:Having finally watched The Godfather Part I and II last month for the first time, I became like most fans of this beloved franchise captivated by the complex characters and storyline.

6534  I was prepared to call this underrated... nope!!! After 50 minutes it lost my attention completely, I don‚Äôt care about old white men or the Pope.

6535  Finally brought myself around to watching this. Kind of wish I hadn‚Äôt.Ok ok ok, after second viewing it wasn‚Äôt that bad. I just wasn‚Äôt expecting as much the family drama/incest aspect, and Sophia‚Äôs acting is as bad as everyone says (sorry, I tried to keep an open mind but, would have loved to have seen the role in the hands of another actress).¬†That being said, it‚Äôs still got some memorable lines and scenes, and the real world event‚Ä¶

6540  The first thought when discussing ‚ÄúThe Godfather: Part III‚Äù is one of defense: it is NOT one of the most bastardizing final films in a trilogy ever, it is not the worst thing Coppola has ever done, and it does NOT soil anything Coppola sets up with his trilogy ‚Äì if anything, when understanding that Coppola intends the first two to be grouped together and this is almost an optional viewing (he calls the series a duology, this an epilogue),‚Ä¶  
6541 Grata sorpresa con la √∫ltima pel√≠cula de la mejor trilog√≠a de la historia del cine. Partiendo de la idea de que mis expectativas eran m√°s bien bajas y de que sus predecesoras son dos obras maestras, la he disfrutado much√≠simo. El cierre de la cinta es brutal. Aqu√≠ Francis Ford Coppola hace una magn√≠fica referencia a la obra de Alfred Hitchcock ‚ÄòThe Man Who Knew Too Much‚Äô (1956), creando unas secuencias de tensi√≥n dignas de alabar, con m√∫sica de fondo de la brillante √≥pera de Mascagni, Cavalleria Rusticana (los pelos de punta).

6545  From what I heard, I expected The Godfather Part III to be some awful end to the trilogy that isn't worth anyone's time.While Part III certainly isn't as encompassing or memorable as its predecessors, it holds up fine as a mafia movie. Nothing incredible, but not at all as bad as I thought. Sofia Coppola's acting was pretty grim and a certain scene involving a pair of glasses was equally bad, but the rest of the film was on‚Ä¶

6548  I have no idea why but it has taken me 20 years to decide to watch THE GODFATHER PART 3. I watched the first two parts as a eager teen getting into film but then nothing until now. Watching it years later without a rewatch gave me unfamiliarity with the world and it‚Äôs characters, everyone felt new and I had to check a couple of times if the characters had been in the previous parts. Focusing on Al Pacino and‚Ä¶  
6549  THE GODFATHER, PART III completes a story of epic proportions:¬† ¬†* THE GODFATHER has a theme of Loss and The Fall;¬† ¬†* THE GODFATHER, PART II is focused on Damnation;¬† ¬†* THE GODFATHER, PART III is the search for Redemption.¬† ¬†¬†Many sequels reflect back on points from their previous movies. ¬†Sometimes, it is essential to have seen what happened before so as not to be completely lost or spending too much time‚Ä¶  
6550 The final instalment of the Godfather series sees an older Michael Corleone attempting to get away from the criminal dealings and legitimize his business by linking up with the Vatican in Italy. ¬†At the same time he takes his hot headed nephew Vincent under his wing. ¬†Clearly not the best of the series but this is a nice progression from the first two that gives this a decent end. ¬†Al Pacino is good as expected. Andy Garcia does a fine job as his nephew.¬†A little on the slow side but still a nice revisit. 
6551 quite frankly this film doesn't hold the big dick energy the first two have! also i was praying for mary to die bc her and that incest subplot were annoying as fuck but learning that's sofia coppola i feel bad but at least she's learned her place is BEHIND the camera! 
6552  Honestly, I'm just happy that Coppola didn't feel any need to do a The Godfather: Part IV during the last thirty years. Let's hope it stays this way.This final entry into the Godfather trilogy is lackluster and underwhelming in comparison to the first two films, but still inhabits a high quality as a standalone film. It's not of the same flesh that The Godfather and The Godfather: Part II were made of; all the ingredients are there, but their‚Ä¶  
6553  In keeping with my dining analogies to compare Godfather films, the first is like eating out with your family at your favorite restaurant, the second is an all-out black-tie affair at your uncle's exclusive country club with two hundred relatives, and this entry is like having brunch at the diner with your buddies. Ain't nothin' wrong with cheap comfort food amongst good friends; the experience hits the right spots.In this final entry to Coppola and Puzo's classic mafia tale,‚Ä¶  
6554 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   I've long loved The Godfather and The Godfather Part II, but I had never actually taken the time to watch Part III. The film's horrendously negative reputation was certainly known to me, but I think more than anything I was just fully satisfied with the first two Godfather films. I just didn't see the need for any more. Still, I knew eventually I'd have to see it and the last few years as seen a growing narrative that the film‚Ä¶   
6555 There are offputting rumours that Francis Ford Coppola only made this belated sequel to finance a personal project, and his daughter (Sofia Coppola) does an unfortunately embarrassing job as a stand-in for Winona Ryder (whether or not it's because she's up against the calibre of Pacino, Garcia, Keaton, etc or because she was just plain bad). Overall, The Godfather, Part III is of course nowhere near as competent as the original two, but it is sweeping and grand-looking enough - with dots of extreme violence - to be possessive of that true 'Godfather' ambience. Heavily flawed, yet still belonging. 
6556 I think this film suffered from the time jump in the story, the absence of Robert Duvall and Sofia Coppola's performance.Very underrated film, I can understand why so many people don't appreciate it as the other two films but I cannot agree, it's a very good film on it's own and I can't watch the godfather without it.

6560 I‚Äôve never watched the Coda version of GFIII and had only watched the theatrical once when it came out so this is pretty much a first viewing for meAfter collecting my thoughts, I think it‚Äôs best to not get into details (like wtf is going on with the incest subplot?!) and just say that even though it has a few moments, the reputation of Godfather III as a complete mess is well-earned 
6561 The older I get, the more obsessed I am with this one. Sophia really is giving that girl from the last season of Curb Your Enthusiasm tho. 
6562 It‚Äôs just impossible to watch this movie and not wonder what a better version of it would be. It‚Äôs a good send off for Michael Corleone but it‚Äôs no¬†where near the masterpieces that are the first two. 
6563  This movie is so bad it makes me physically upset. I can't believe they ended what could have easily been a great trilogy with one of the worst films I've ever had the displeasure of sitting through. It is baffling this movie was released. Horribly written, acted, shot, and edited; this really is a low blow for Coppola who a decade prior came out of one of the greatest streaks of filmmaking in cinema history. Nothing works or pays off.‚Ä¶  
6564  I wanted to be the dissenting voice and at times I seemed I would be‚Ä¶but this movie is a mess. It‚Äôs not just Sofia Coppola‚Ä¶though her acting seemed to get worse as the movie went on to a point where it went from passable to just sigh-inducing. It‚Äôs the fact it spends too much time in the specific politics of Michael buying the Immobliari, it‚Äôs the bizarre out of left field editing choices, it‚Äôs moments of overblown bombast, and Vinny‚Ä¶who‚Ä¶  
6565  Why do people dislike this? This is legit a great movie, just not as good as its predecessors.Coppola still shows he‚Äôs a masterful director in this one. The sequence at the opera is fantastic and the acting from the whole cast is, for the most part, really good (yes, Sofia Coppola‚Äôs performance is terrible). The dialogue was pretty bad too from time to time.It‚Äôs obviously not the masterpiece the other Godfather movies are, but as far as trilogies‚Ä¶  
6566  "Look how they massacred my boy!"Monumentally disappointing. I watched this right after seeing Part II for the first time in years and the difference in quality is quite honestly astounding. I‚Äôve had my problems with II in the past (mainly because of its pacing) but seeing it as an adult reaffirmed its place for me as one of the all-time great movies ‚Äì a wonderfully tragic opera about the birth and death of the American dream under capitalism and‚Ä¶  
6567 not the greatest sequel of all time but hopefully they don't remake it. 
6568 Sofia Coppola is easily the biggest miscasted actor of the 90s along with Keanu Reeves in Dracula. Watching her gave me a migraine the size of a tumor.Andy Garcia is all slick and no substance.Diane Keaton mumbles around.Talia Shire is dressed in black most of the time.Pacino is the only positive thing about this lumbering blunder.The whole Vatican sub plot is just lazy writing.Part 1 was the perfect marriage of art and mainstream while the second one was a Greek Tragedy.This one is a trainwreck and was a slog. 
6569  Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll meI ain't the sharpest tool in the shedShe was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumbIn the shape of an "L" on her foreheadWell, the years start coming and they don't stop comingFed to the rules and I hit the ground runningDidn't make sense not to live for funYour brain gets smart but your head gets dumbSo much to do,‚Ä¶  
6570  I honestly don't know what movie other people were watching.You hate Sofia Coppola? Fine. She makes a better director than an actress, I agree. But if you think she's horrible, you haven't seen enough movies. I can show you horrible acting.Was it the tying in of the 30 day reign of John Paul I with a Vatican conspiracy angle? I have some Oliver Stone movies you should probably watch.Is it because Michael Corleone was made to pay‚Ä¶  
6571  ...Eh?Let's be honest: it's nowhere near as good as the first two films. It's not as well directed (did Coppola demature as a filmmaker? Is that even possible?), it's not as well shot, not as well acted and not nearly as well scripted. It's really hard to care about the plot, and it makes you wonder why after the engaging stories of Part 1 and Part 2 we now get a dull, pretty uneventful story involving stock in a‚Ä¶

6574 77/100Faults are as prominent as ever, even more so after reading some about the production (Coppola patently refused to make a third and ended up practically forced into it), but so are its virtues. Simply put, this contains dozens of moments that gnaw at my insides, many of which stand above anything from the first two (despite those being more "perfect" films). All things being equal, the final hour or so is one of the finest stretches of film ever put to the screen.2nd watch 
6575 Una decepci√≥n total pero se gan√≥ las tres estrellas x el actorazo que es al pacino y porque actu√≥ la linda de sofia coppola 
6576  a film at odds with legitimacy itself. don't the first two parts go down so easily? not their matter‚Äîthese are horror films skinned atop charming corpses. but their timbre that feels recognizable. the method performances that just a few years earlier felt at odds with systems of production have been so quickly adopted as inevitable facets of screen-acting. Lee Strasberg literally sets the pace! and Pacino's quiet rot, Brando's retrained rage, Cazale's squirm...these all feel recognizable as what we point‚Ä¶

6579 Havent seen the "Coppola Cut " but this is....not bad lol. Maybe im taking COPPIUM with this but Sofia Coppola is fine. Yeah an actress wouldve been better but she was a literal last minute replacement for Winona Ryder so im not taking any shit about that! The film is not a complete story and is absolutely missing some things (By some things I mean Robert Duvall) but its a good conclusion to Michael's arc and with Coppola its obviously a comptently made movie. "Never let anyone know what you are thinking."

6582 The Godfather Children of Deaf Adults 
6583 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Eh, it‚Äôs really not that bad. I watched the recently released Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone version for the first time. At first I didn‚Äôt like how they no longer show Michael collapse and die. But the more I think about it, the more I like how in this new ending, it‚Äôs like Michael is cursed to live isolated and alone, with no family or loved ones to be seen. A very depressing but fitting end to the character.  
6584  The cut I watched is The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone. Re-edited by Coppola to be more of an extension of the first two movies than a sequel, and given the original title instead of The Godfather: Part III. Based on the introduction from Coppola included on my DVD and what I‚Äôve read online, I think this cut is as close to what he intended for the movie as you can get. The quality of this movie is‚Ä¶  
6585  Viewed The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone cut.¬†I honestly couldn‚Äôt have had a more perfect viewing chronology to properly and fully appreciate this new Coda cut. Seeing Godfather 3 in theaters in 1990, then waiting 30 years to revisit it just this last September. Now with that viewing fresh in mind, watching this newly edited and gorgeously remastered version. This is honestly just short of a revelation and one of the better such reduxes I‚Äôve seen from‚Ä¶  
6586 Even though it is the Fredo of the Godfather films. Like Fredo it is still deserves some respect. 
6587  Well I‚Äôve finally completed the series. I went into this with low expectations as you would expect and somehow they weren‚Äôt met.I will say there are flashes of great acting here, in the case of Pacino, Keaton and Garcia. Some of the more emotional moments from the couple were great. And I love how Garcia held the temperament of a Vito or a Sonny. But I did have an issue with Pacino because Michael felt so overdone and bloated‚Ä¶  
6588  "Just when I think I'm out...they pull me back in!"I paired Part 3 with Coppola's Cabernet Sauvignon. It was fine. My wife disliked it. She said it stung her mouth. I didn't have that experience, I thought it had less of a bitter aftertaste than the Merlot. My favorite of the 3 Coppola wines that I had, however, was definitely the Claret that I paired with the original "Godfather". I will definitely be buying and enjoying that one again.‚Ä¶  
6589 (coda: the death of michael corleone)the donkey impression WHAT. 
6590  As diretrizes da vida ganham novo ensejo na medida em que o homem escolhe seus caminhos e, depois, colhe de seus frutos. Ningu√©m est√° isento das consequ√™ncias de suas escolhas, e Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), tendo feito muitas coisas em nome de sua fam√≠lia, agora resvala as emo√ß√µes de um homem que deleita-se com o fruto de seu esfor√ßo, enquanto pena pelos √≥cios provindos de seus empreendimentos.The Godfather: Part III (1990), sem sobra de d√∫vida, foi o melhor filme‚Ä¶  
6591 Mario Puzo's The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael CorleoneAfter watching both the theatrical version and the re-cut back to back I can say that while there is an improvement with the re-cut it's genuinely not that much of a difference but I'm glad that Francis Ford Coppola is happy with it. His little introduction explaining his reasoning for the changes was so cute.Listen to the Uncut Gems Podcast 
6592 ‚ÄúNever hate your enemies, It affects your judgment‚ÄùI don‚Äôt know how but I‚Äôm both shocked and not surprised. This is a good film, i mean it‚Äôs The Godfather, but honestly it‚Äôs not as good as the first two. And Michael didn‚Äôt deserve that. It‚Äôs so sad where the storyline ended. Also, when Andy Garcia was introduced as Sonny‚Äôs son I just knew he would have a little bit of a temper lol. 
6593  Coda Edition:¬†‚ÄúMy lucky coat!‚ÄùContrary to what some are saying I don‚Äôt think this is any better than the theatrical release. If anything, I preferred the previous beginning and ending. Not that I particularly like Part III anyway. Yes, Andy Garcia gives the best performance, and yes, the botched apartment murder and opera scenes are good, but it‚Äôs not enough to salvage so many terrible scenes, dialogue and acting. It‚Äôs not just bad in comparison to the first two,‚Ä¶  
6594  Francis Ford Coppola had the best decade a director has ever and will ever have in the 1970's. He was nominated for 12 oscars and won 6(I'm counting The Godfathers best picture win as a win for him). He was bound to decline a little after that, especially considering Apocalypse Now nearly killed him. With all that being said, Part III is still really fucking good., that third act is stressful as fuck, I don't think I have any fingernails‚Ä¶  
6595  I cannot remember The Godfather Part III well enough to say what has changed in relation to the recut The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone, but watching the film again in this form has given me a new appreciation for the movie. It isn't Part I or II, but it is a good watch. The new cut is clear and operatic, in the best way. It is a big, occasionally loud, Shakespearan drama about the inability to achieve‚Ä¶  
6596 Coda version.Too much God, not enough Father. 
6597 (Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone [2020]) While nowhere near the genius and craftsmanship of the first two films, this one is an enjoyable crime drama with some powerful performances from the cast, especially Diane Keaton and Al Pacino. I like the new version of this, with a tiny but powerful alteration to the final scene. Not a masterpiece, but a good, underrated film nevertheless. 
6598 The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone.Definitely an improvement over the original version. The first act flows much better because of the rearrangement of scenes, something which keeps it from feeling watered down like the old version did. Also, the new music cues added were fantastic and helped it fit in better with the previous two films. Overall I enjoyed it, however I prefer the original ending. 
6599  Not sure how this can actually be improved by recutting it, but okay. Do what Zack Snyder is doing for Justice League, polish the turd!In all seriousness, unlike Justice League (the Snyder Cut, granted, will be better), I can actually see a good movie buried in the mediocrity here.¬†This movie has competent directing, and besides Sofia Coppola‚Äôs awful performance, decent acting. A couple lines are pretty good. The cinematography, sound, art direction, and editing are still pretty great.‚Ä¶  
6600  Eu tinha dezessete anos de idade da primeira e √∫ltima vez que tive contato com o corte original de O Poderoso Chef√£o III. Assisti-o imediatamente ap√≥s ver os outros dois cap√≠tulos da trilogia (que eu tamb√©m havia visto pela primeira vez √† √©poca), e ciente de que a opini√£o p√∫blica o julgava um desfecho fraco em compara√ß√£o aos filmes anteriores.N√£o me lembro muito bem o porqu√™ de eu n√£o ter gostado tanto do filme quando o vi. Acho que‚Ä¶  
6601 It's weird not watching Godfather Part III for twenty years and then watching it two days in a row with two different cuts. I think both cuts have their merits, and it's interesting to see where Coda goes for subtlety and where it chooses to be a bit more aggressive in its tone. Ultimately, I think both cuts are worth seeing, although I wouldn't say Coda is so radically different that it changes the overall themes, issues, and impact of the original version. 
6602 there was just something really off in here, the incest ¬ø¬ø????the ending of the opera scene broke me though 
6603 Remember that trailer for The Mummy that was really awkward because it got leaked without any music, and the whole flow of everything was off? That‚Äôs this whole movie. 
6604 three major flaws:1. incest oh my fucking god2. sofia coppola‚Äôs acting3. michael‚Äôs hair 
6605 Agak mengecewakan, tidak sebagus dan sehebat yang pertama dan kedua, feel-nya juga ngak seterasa yang pertama dan kedua, tapi ini bukan film yang buruk sebagai penutup trilogi ini. 
6606 I do love Michael's self-reflection as he has gotten old, and how the life he chose has had a terrible toll on him. Al Pacino once again delivers a great performance. But the rest of the film is kinda, idk how to explain it, really. It's just kinda weird. Idk. Maybe I should rewatch it and that will make my thoughts clearer. Anyway solid movie and good ending. 
6607  I do got to say that this barely felt like a film in the Godfather trilogy. It just felt too different than the first two masterpieces. Most of the great characters are all gone. But on the other hand i in no way hated this film in fact I actually liked it. It finishes an arc for Michael which I already thought was already complete after the second film. I do in fact now think that Michael Corleone is the‚Ä¶  
6608  What triggered me after watching this picture is that there are a lot of similar elements in it as in the first and second part. I watched them all three in three days, but the people who watched The Godfather in 1972 and 1974 and then went back to the cinema in 1990 must have thought the same thing, I think. A lot of things came back (maybe a little too much?). The casting is great in this picture, especially‚Ä¶  
6609  If this were any normal gangster film it‚Äôd be perfectly fine, but as a finale to two of the greatest films ever made it‚Äôs just slightly underwhelming. There‚Äôs still a lot to enjoy, with the film moving the character of Michael Corleone forward in a heartfelt, natural way, and Pacino is once again superb. Also terrific are most of the rest of the cast, returning in the case of Keaton and Shire, or new in Garcia and Wallach (and just‚Ä¶  
6610 I was with it until the incest subplot came up. The thing is: it's not a horrible concept - Michael answering to the hurt he's caused in a later stage of life. The problem is: the film just doesn't do much interesting with the idea, and you can tell the cast just doesn't want to be there. Michael's confession and the opera sequence in the back half nearly make this decent, but by that point, the damage has been done.Perhaps it's better just to forget this exists. Disappointing. 
6611 they should have left it as a duology 
6612  Why Puzo and Coppola thought that the relationship between Andy Garcia and Sofia Coppola was as good idea is beyond my comprehension.¬†Why Coppola thought casting his inexperienced daughter in a substantial role in one of the most (if not THE most) anticipated sequels of all times is way beyond me.¬†There are so many factors that could have been improved or prevented to make this a really GREAT film like its predecessors. Robert Duvall should have been paid and‚Ä¶  
6613  I know there's nothing original about slamming on The Godfather: Part III. I'll say immediately too that Al Pacino performs admirably. I remembered this being shouty, later period Pacino but he's quite reserved and plays an older, wiser Michael to a T. The film remains largely disappointing in spite of this.Recently, my wife and I took a journey through the life of Michael Corleone. I've seen the trilogy many times over but it was a first for her so‚Ä¶  
6614 i really thought this was directed by someone else 
6615 what in the incest 
6616  1991 Director‚Äôs CutI will never understand why The Godfather Part III (1990) is so underrated and to be honest I‚Äôve given up trying to. If this movie was a stand alone film and not the third instalment of a trilogy, which includes arguably the two greatest films of all time, it would be regarded as a classic of the crime genre, that I am sure of.Al Pacino is sublime once again as Don Michael Corleone, the crime boss‚Ä¶  
6617 i really wish this hadn't been made lmao 
6618 Honestly don't think I've seen a more disappointing sequel in my life 
6619 Andy Garcia's chest hair should have been nominated for an Oscar 
6620  Went in with low expectations yet this still disappointed me. Unlike the first two films in the series, this failed to hold my attention for the most part. A huge chunk of the plot focuses around this Vatican conspiracy which is so uninteresting. Then there‚Äôs the incest subplot‚Ä¶ What the fuck were Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo thinking? It‚Äôs also true that Sofia Coppola‚Äôs performance is dreadful (thank fuck she‚Äôs a good director) but she and the rest of‚Ä¶  
6621 it‚Äôs a shame this came out in the same year as goodfellas and is following up two of the greatest films of all time because‚Ä¶. it‚Äôs actually pretty good. the underworld plot is a bit half baked compared the last two but i do like how reflective it is for michael, regrets and sins, chickens coming home to roost and the last 30 mins of this? fantastic tension building and filmmaking.sofia coppola stinks as an actress but it‚Äôs a good one. 
6622  üÜó 68%1st Watch | Francis Ford Coppola Ranked | Mafia RankedBefore I review The Godfather: Part III, it's important to recap on the prior two entires in the Godfather trilogy.The Godfather was an technical masterpiece that became iconic due to its astounding direction, impeccable screenplay, but most importantly acting (including the one-of-a-kind performance from Marlon Brando). This movie is one of my favorite movies and includes some of my favorite moments in cinema (and as of when‚Ä¶  
6623 Stunned. Grateful.Goodfellas wishes. 
6624 (Coda)Any problems or defects people adscribe (unfairly, in my opinion) to Part III are more than redeemed by the pure, unfiltered emotion of it all and the virtuosic craft of Coppola and Willis. The confession scene is extraordinary, honest filmmaking. 
6625 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Francis Ford Coppola: the man who can give you some of the greatest films of all time, and at the same time, thisWithout a doubt, Coppola just set the bar too high with the first II parts of The Godfather Trilogy, it was certainly difficult to create three masterpieces for a trilogy. Even so, it‚Äôs not horrible as many people think.¬†In this film, we see an older Michael Corleone, more ‚Äúmature‚Äù, experienced, who supposedly learned from his past‚Ä¶   
6626 In my opinion this wasn't needed. It kind of feels like they made this just to have The Godfather as a trilogy. It's simply just unneeded for the series. At many parts I just think it felt like a family drama. It doesn't remind me at all of the other two. The only thing carrying this movie to not being a complete disaster is Al Pacino. 
6627  everybody fretting about whether this is either terrible or just in the shadow of two of the greatest movies of all time is ignoring how hot Andy Garcia is??? like wtf, totally undersold.

Erice! I've been there! I love Italy.Part III should be rated lower (it has Sofia Coppola's horrendous acting, a plot so convoluted I can't even summarize it, and a lack of subtlety that insults the first two Godfather films), but I'm a Sucker for an Italian setting, so somehow it's ending up with 3.5 stars. Sue me!

6633 This was alright up until about an hour in. Like, I was quite enjoying it and briefly thought it may be better than the other two entires- the first of which I wasn't a big fan and the second which was pretty good. But it just got stupid, and I felt myself bored. The ending has bumped it up by a margin, as it was strong. This is definitely, in my opinion, the most overrated and uneven trilogy. 
6634 look at how they massacred my boy's barnet 
6635  I know everyone gives this a bad rep but for a long time this was the second best Godfather film in my opinion, so I've never despised it as some do. If I'm being honest, if every single critic lauded the film and it was deemed a masterpiece like the first 2 films, you would see a bunch of people also proclaiming it to be one of the greats. I think we as a species are too susceptible to what‚Ä¶  
6636  "Just when I thought I was out... they pull me back in." - Michael CorleoneI like to think of The Godfather Trilogy as apples, since the first one is nice and crunchy, the second is incredibly sweet which makes you wonder if you'll ever taste an apple that is anywhere near as good as that one. Then finally, 1990's The Godfather: Part III which is the apple that makes you wonder who put a cheap apple into the basket?‚Ä¶  
6637 It must have felt near impossible to follow up on the sheer masterpieces that Godfather Part 1 and 2 are. However it feels like there wasn‚Äôt an attempt here? The writing and direction here is truly abhorrent, the whole Mary-Vincent story is really, really grim and left a sour taste in my mouth throughout. In his final swan song as Michael Corleone however, Pacino performs to his usual standard here and I would have actually enjoyed Garcia as Vincent if it wasn‚Äôt for that story. Such a fall from Grace and it‚Äôs no wonder Coppola sees this franchise as a duology 
6638 Watched the Coda versionUpping to 7/10 from 6/10 I've seen this one less than the other two. I remember Sofia Coppola (Mary) being a lot worse.

6639  when people ask me why I love this trilogy so much I just think of family, that's very important to me. part 2 is my favorite because it shows the past of vito corleone, it shows how he grew up without parents and brothers because they were murdered by the mafia, but he got old and took revenge on those who did wrong to his family, becoming the new boss of Mafia. but you see, even though he became a‚Ä¶

6641  (Watched the 2020 cut ‚ÄúThe Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone‚Äù)As someone whose never seen the original release I thought this was pretty good. I totally agree this is a mostly unnecessary edition to an almost flawless previous two films, but I also admit that I had a good time watching it.¬†The biggest flaws are definitely Sofia‚Äôs acting, the much too long climax, and most of Vincent‚Äôs arc. Everything he did was fine, but as he wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶  
6642 Very big downgrade from the other 2, but it's definitely not awful. I wouldn't go as far as to say it's the worst sequel or movie of all time, it has some good moments. Positives aside, I couldn't tell if Sofia Coppola was genuinely acting or completely bored on set. She definitely isn't for acting, but she's a great director! 
6643 He should be careful. It's dangerous to be an honest man.The incest plot kinda threw me off a bit. 
6644 sofia coppola can not fake cry for shit but i still love her 
6645 Ok. So.¬†As the trilogy closes, so does the story of Michael Corleone. It‚Äôs a fantastic trilogy, but it‚Äôs not without its flaws. Part III gets the short end of the stick here, as with a run-time of 2.50, Coppola has to tie everything up as well as the tough job of making a satisfying conclusion to the Godfather¬†series as a whole.¬†And it‚Äôs great. It‚Äôs a bit tedious at times, and it can get a little repetitive, but the end result is worth it, even if ¬†the whole thing seems unnecessary (Coppola didn‚Äôt even wanna make¬†a third entry, but here we are..). 
6646 i can believe that al pacino it's going to die one day 
6647 550th film already and it was the actiony conclusion to the tragedy of cinema's It Girl, Michael Corleone. Across the trilogy, he just went from babe to bitchass to broken.Vincent gave off massive "try to be pretty" vibes, Zasa is actually the future silver fox David Rossi, and Mary was kinda poogie despite Sofia Coppola's performance, which by the way is miles better than that of her one-time boyfriend Quentin Tarantino two years after this came out. Recommend me a movie here!

6650  "Never hate your enemies.It affects your judgement."Finally, I finished the trilogy!Tragic. Dramatic. Revenge.I know this is not the best part of the Godfather, without this the two parts before were just fine. But it still good, although It was hard to finish Part III because it is very slow.The Godfather: Part III (1990) sebenarnya punya rentang waktu yang agak jauh dibandingkan dengan The Godfather: Part II (1974). Untungnya masih disutradarai orang yang sama jadi feelnya‚Ä¶  
6651 esse filme foi um grande banho de l√°grimas, sinto que n√£o precisava dessa tristeza toda e aquele final nossa... simplesmente uma das coisas mais lindas e dolorosas.al pacino entregou a melhor atua√ß√£o da vida dele nesse filme, se conectou ainda mais com o personagem e por mais que n√£o chegue aos p√©s dos dois primeiros eu n√£o acho que seja um filme desnecess√°rio. 
6652  I wanted to see the original cut before watching the Coda version, but looks like the studio has essentially replaced that version.So without ever seeing the original cut, I thought this was very good. There is certainly a major step-down from the first two films, but Al Pacino is still a master in this role. And a young Andy Garcia pulls more than his own weight. Enough has been said about Sofia Coppola‚Äôs performance so I won‚Äôt tear her‚Ä¶  
6653 i love you michael corleone i will always love you 
6654  This is one of the most underrated, and over hated movies I ever saw, although it does pale in comparison to its predecessors, it‚Äôs still a great movie in its own right. There are lots of stuff this movie does right, first of all almost all the performances (with the exception Sofia Copula) vary from solid, to absolutely brilliant, Cinematography and soundtrack work together with absolute perfection here, and it was refreshing that this movie accomplished what it set to‚Ä¶  
6655  Mario Puzo's The Godfather Coda: The Death Of Michael Corleone‚ÄúJust when I thought I was out‚Ä¶they pull me back in.‚ÄùMediocre at times, The Godfather Part III definitely doesn‚Äôt meet the standard set by its predecessors, but manages to barely recover by carrying over a percentage of the influence that came before it. This does not go without saying that the performances ranged from barley tolerable to solid. Al Pacino is stiff and looks like he has had enough‚Ä¶  
6656  The first two Godfather films are a hard act to follow, and while Part III fails to live up to its predecessors, it's mainly in comparison to the two titans that came before it. The third in the trilogy wants to expand the legacy even further, but at times it feels more like it is basking in its old glory, without adding quite as much to it as it could.And still, if you ignore the huge footsteps it tries‚Ä¶  
6657  Scavenger Hunt 85: Film #4 of 30"He's your first cousin.""Then I'll love him first."The Godfather Part 3 is a movie that shouldn't exist, but does try its hardest to be like the previous two films. There's some conceptually great stuff here and a handful of sequences and moments that are genuinely great, but they're surrounded by numerous issues. This film is an hour too long, trying to match the length of the other two films without having‚Ä¶  
6658  ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the point of confession if you don‚Äôt repent‚ÄùMy grandfather was a film critic at one point in his life and one of my favorite memories with him was going out for Chinese food at this local place he loved and him explaining to me that his favorite of The Godfather films was the third. I was shocked to say the least but I honestly can‚Äôt remember if he ever elaborated on why he felt that way. Seeing it‚Ä¶  
6659 Never watched it before so seeing this for the first time in the cinema was again a very great experience. I don‚Äôt think it is a bad film by any means and it wasn‚Äôt as bad as I was expecting but it‚Äôs just doesn‚Äôt have the excellence of the previous two. Al Pacino is excellent, Diane Keaton is brilliant, for the little amount of time she‚Äôs in it sadly, and Andy Garcia was great too but that‚Äôs about as far as it goes performance wise.¬†Seeing the three Godfather films in cinema has been such a pleasure, a truly amazing experience every single time. 
6660 It‚Äôs like comparing Lord of the Rings movies with The Hobbit movies 
6661  This really missed the magic and flare of the previous two films. Part 3 wasn't entirely bad, there were some subtle moments in it that I deeply loved like the scenes when Michael remembers his marriage with Appolonia and tears up and how he breaks down over what he did to his brother Fredo, those scenes I really loved and connected to, but the majority of the film was just very mediocre. I wasn't very fond of that weird incest‚Ä¶  
6662 Ah yes! TucoüòØ!After so many years, he finally became a Don üòåüôå! "Connie, All my life I've kept trying to go up in society.

Never expected it to be this painful and tragic.I'm actually underwhelmed thoüòê. Gotta see the 2020 recutüôå! 
6663 If we could erase Sofia Coppola from this film, it would elevate it immensely. Still a fantastic film even if it's not as good as 1 and 2. 
6664  It's becoming less and less of a hot take to say this isn't a terrible movie, it's just not good by the impossibe Godfather standard. Of course Sophia Coppola is awful, but it's pretty obvious that she was a last minute replacement who didn't want to be there, and I honestly think her entire performance might be a giant middle finger to the old man. What doesn't get talked about enough is how bad the actor playing Anthony is; for‚Ä¶  
6665 we talked about  The Godfather, The Godfather: Part II, and The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone  on the extended clip after-hours feed with our friend Rob Franco. it used to be behind the paywall but now it's free. one of us had a Godfather themed Bar Mitzvah, but who? only one way to find out... soundcloud.com/extendedclip/bonus-unlocked-godfather-bar-mitzvah 
6666  Two bits of trivia tell you all you need to know about The Godfather Part III:Francis Ford Coppola once admitted that he was still unhappy over the final result because of lack of time to write the script. According to him, he had wanted $6 million for the writer, producer, and director fee and 6 months to write the script. Instead, the studio gave him only $1 million in fees and only 6 weeks to work on the script‚Ä¶  
6667 Definitely the weakest out of the trilogy but still very good. Personally I liked it better than the first but that‚Äôs just me. The acting was great and I liked the way it was shot. Also big up Sofia Coppola, damn she was beautiful.¬†Overall to sum up the series I think it is an amazing trilogy, and ranked from worst to best I would go, 3, 1, 2.

6669 Am I being generous with this star rating? yes, definitely.But honestly? I did enjoy it. 
6670  [CODA CUT]Not as great of an improvement as I was hoping for narratively‚Äîcase and point being the continued inclusion of Sofia Coppola. With this technically better looking and sounding remaster, FFC cuts out roughly 20min to help pacing, rearranging the entire narrative structure of the film, overhauling it to flow smoother. I don't think it does as drastic as expected of a job in raising the dramatic tension of the more monotonous exposition in story, but certainly a worthy‚Ä¶  
6671 The new cut made this movie better. Having that said, I still really don‚Äôt like Michael‚Äôs haircut, but I guess Francis Ford Coppola couldn‚Äôt fix that. 
6672  Ninguna pel√≠cula de El padrino hasta su tercer episodio hab√≠a sido realista. Gangsters que suenan como S√©neca; masacres de todos los enemigos de una familia criminal; asesinatos en lugares p√∫blicos sin posibilidad de huida: no son cosas que realmente pasen o hayan pasado en la historia de la Cosa Nostra; sin embargo eran excepciones en narrativas que ten√≠an mucho que criticar sobre el estado de las cosas en lo que los estadounidenses llaman America. Las instituciones se revelaban como corruptas‚Ä¶  
6673 Digan lo que quieran, pero la principal raz√≥n por la que esta tercera parte se siente d√©bil, es porque Coppola hizo las dos anteriores completamente desnudo pasando su gran miembro por la historia del cine.Con m√°s visionados, a√∫n se siente una buena conclusi√≥n; y a pesar de sus errores, tiene varios momentos emocionales alrededor de la decadencia de Michael Corleone. Encima ustedes quieren que la odie y la actuaci√≥n de Al Pacino literal me hace llorar. Qu√© hombre por favor. 
6674 FFC has done an effective job fixing this up. It‚Äôs still marred by what it‚Äôs marred by, but less so (he‚Äôs cut a lot of Sofia‚Äôs worst moments, and certainly cleared up the narrative). And it looks and sounds great. If you‚Äôd given up on ever watching ‚ÄúThree‚Äù again, this is worth your time.

6676 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   ‚ÄúNever hate your enemies. It affects your judgment.‚ÄùThe Godfather: Part III is the final entry in Francis Ford Coppola‚Äôs The Godfather trilogy and was released in 1990. ¬†It follows ageing Mafia Don Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) as he seeks to avow for his sins and takes his nephew Vincent Mancini (Andy Garc√≠a) under his wing.¬†As I mentioned in my The Godfather: Part II review, I feel like that film had a perfect ending so going into this I‚Ä¶   
6677  To be completely honest, most of this is pretty entertaining and there are some a few great sequences... it's just that none of it packs any real emotional weight like the other two films. It just feels useless, like a bonus DVD feature that has next to no impact on the viewer's assessment of the series. The ending, in particular, is so laughable. I was expecting it to go on for another half an hour, but it just ended with‚Ä¶  
6678  wow, it did not feel like a sequel to the godfather at all. however, if you watch it as a standalone gangster film, it‚Äôs crazy good and absolutely deserving of its best picture nomination. it did not deserve to win though, so i‚Äôm happy it lost. a necessary conclusion that should be watched with crazy low expectations, that‚Äôs why i enjoyed it.¬†sofia coppola‚Äôs acting was mostly okay, but oh my god was it really bad in some scenes!¬†i‚Ä¶  
6679 Part III is unfortunately not nearly as good as its two predecessors and pretty much an offer I can easily refuse. But indeed, the whole opera showdown at the end is pretty exciting. Also the death of Mary and the ending of the movie was hard to watch. Pacinos acting is just heartbreaking in those scenes! And also the music, especially the main theme, gets me everytime. 
6680 I don't understand why since the moment I watched The Godfather in high school all I ever heard about Part 3 were negative. Like people really hated this? Had me tearing up in the end. 
6681 Ok...it‚Äôs not a terrible movie, but to be something that follows two of the objectively best films of all time, it‚Äôs disappointing as hell. It looks too new to be a Godfather movie, ya know what i mean? I knew it wasn‚Äôt gonna be great or anything, in fact, there wre some scenes that I really liked, but it was just so boring. Do not let Sofia Coppola step in front of a camera ever again. She was terrible in The Outsiders, she was terrible in this. 
6682  Mucha gente odiaba/odia esta pel√≠cula... Pero el grito silencioso de Michael es uno de los momentos m√°s poderosos que HE VISTO en el cine.Simplemente punt√∫a la historia.

6683  This is a significant drop off from the first two Godfather films, obviously. While it lacks the tensity of the first two films, it still has some great moments.¬†Dear God, it has to be said. Every scene Maria was in I was cringing. Let this be a lesson to us all: don‚Äôt hire your daughter to be a lead actress in a film that you‚Äôre directing. An absolutely horrifying performance that changes the trajectory of the entire film.¬†Thanks‚Ä¶

6689 The Godfather Part III had a great ending that concluded the trilogy well. Al Pachino and Dianne Keaton were pretty good in here, and it‚Äôs still a well made film and cinematography is nice, but not as good as the previous. But just the characters Vincent and Michael‚Äôs daughter you don‚Äôt care about them.

6693 Falls far short of the lofty heights reached by it's predecessors, and in it's attempt to recapture what made them so memorable, almost becomes a lampooning satirical version of itself. Thankfully Pacino delivers a great, grumbling performance, the film is always a pleasure to look at, and there are enough intriguing plotlines woven through this trilogy end cap that you're kept guessing as to what the hell is gonna happen next; the end is quite the payoff. 
6694  [44]THE GODFATHER PART III or: "Hey, Remember THE GODFATHER PARTS I & II?"¬†Then again, is it only a coincidence that the best parts of PART III¬†are the small flashbacks to previous installments? In all honesty, it's not a complete dumpster fire, it's just excessively bland and disengaging, always to be buried in the shadow of its masterpiece-caliber precedessors. Set designers still deserve a ton of credit for making the film nevertheless beautifully grungy and rich with grime, despite the fact‚Ä¶  
6695  Pretty terrible. There are so many problems with this, almost to the point where there are too many to name. Anyway, the big one being this didn't warrant making. The script is terrible - soppy, melodramatic, devoid of nuance - and it adds nothing we didn't already know or understand about Michael Corleone. The performances are terrible, especially on Keaton on Sofia Coppola's side. Even Pacino seems phoned-in. There's a point half way through where Michael and Kay go to‚Ä¶  
6696 It took so long to finish the end of an legendary saga. This movie was a little odd than the first two. Sofia Coppola was very bad in this movie as she was seen much in this movie. Andy Gracia just takes his role to another level and Al Pacino is just legendary.

There are moments of camp, Pacino often seems out of character, and there's also some stuff that doesn't even make sense‚Äîlike how does Vinny go from knucklehead goombah to don material in the space of a couple of weeks?

6705 Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone cutAs someone who is primarily drawn--or even, you might say, PUUUUULLLLLLLLED BACK IN!--to The Godfather movies not for their epic scope or operatic themes of man's downfall or the perversion of Catholic ritual, but for the masterful way in which Coppola develops tension by arranging and re-arranging scenes of men glowering in well-lit rooms, I think I prefer this cut, which foregrounds more of that. That said, I like the original ending better. 
6706  This film gets a lot of hate and yes it‚Äôs it not as good as it‚Äôs predecessors. Nor are there many films that can be compared to The Godfather and The Godfather: Part II, both of which are masterpieces and arguably some of the greatest films ever made.

6713 Trilogy completed. I think this could have been a little more concise, but this still adds a lot of great lore to the series. Michael‚Äôs conscience finally catches up with him and his emotions start to show as he faces his regrets. Vincent is a great addition and one ruthless mf. But, try as she may, Mary is a pretty awful watch and literally kills the momentum of the big ending with a single word. That said, the third act is huge, albeit a little hard to follow. Still a perfectly acceptable entry into the franchise.

6721  Watching this through of the lense of it‚Äôs recent and, according to Francis, definitive recut helped me understand the story as more of a Coda to the original duology as opposed to a trilogy capper, which I think helped me enjoy this a lot more.

6723 Much much better than I expected it to be, Coppola's control of tone and atmosphere is as rich and textured as ever, and there are some sequences in here I would argue hold their own against the best from the first two Godfathers-- who doesn't love a good opera setpiece? But yeah, from a story perspective, Pacino is carrying this one on his back, with a truly upsetting performance as the ailing Michael Corleone; my boy will never beat the overacting allegations but his facial expression in those final moments is just... haunting. The hatred for this one is way overblown.

6725  In giving a wrap-up, a conclusion to two of the most powerful crime and family stories to come out of the seventies, Francis Ford Coppola took a risk that many feel didn't pay off. I almost wish I didn't know what criticisms people had before viewing it again recently (I had seen the film when I was in my early teens, but forgot most of it). Some of them, such as the mis-casting of Sofia Coppola, the long, drawn-out scenes,‚Ä¶  
6726 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  I gotta say that this film is very overhated and sadly wasn‚Äôt as good as the first two Godfather films but it was an acceptable end for the Godfather trilogy, Michael Corleone spent his whole life trying to protect and do everything for his family from his brothers, to close friends and even his own children, but in the end he couldn‚Äôt protect anyone, not even his own daughter. Michael Corleone is undeniably apart of the top 10 greatest characters of all time. Cent'anni.  
6727 A good crime movie but not a great godfather movie and still good movie overall and very over hated 
6728 O filme realmente e o mais fraco da da trilogia, por√©m e um bom filme, mais n√£o e tem grandes acontecimentos marcantes como o outro filme, a hist√≥ria n√£o e t√£o interessante como o outro e uns acontecimentos e adi√ß√µes que deixa muito a desejar, mais ainda curti bastante, atua√ß√µes, figurino, tudo impec√°vel. 
6729 unfortunately spent most of this movie thinking about how much michael corleone reminds me of nicolas sarkozy 
6730 I fell asleep twice. 
6731 Al Pacino falling off a chair like a rag doll might just be the funniest movie ending in cinema history, but also one of the worst. I laughed hysterically to mask the pain of watching almost three hours of pure disrespect towards Part 1 and 2. 
6732 Mira como masacraron a mi muchacho5 teatros de 10 
6733  Why hasn‚Äôt this been reclaimed as some sort of camp classic? Seriously, it‚Äôs packed with the filmic equivalent of purple prose (Joe Mantegna‚Äôs performance, Eli Wallach‚Äôs performance, most of Al Pacino‚Äôs performance, about sixty percent of the dialogue, every shootout scene, and everything that takes place in the last half-hour or so), such that I spent large amounts of it cackling uncontrollably, which just feels wrong for a Godfather film. The plot is insane and incomprehensible, and I couldn‚Äôt decide‚Ä¶  
6734 Watched the newer 2020 recut version - ¬†The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone. Better start and ending for sure vs GF III, and somehow Sofia is edited to be less irritating. 
6735  For its thirtieth anniversary, Francis Ford Coppola revisited and recut The Godfather Part III, retitling it The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone. Coppola streamlined the film, cutting out about thirteen minutes from the 1991 director's cut, and significantly rearranged the beginning and ending of the film. This is the version that I watched, and I found it to be a very good film.The dialogue is not as good or as memorable as the first two films, but‚Ä¶  
6736 not what i expected! just didn‚Äôt have the same feel as the first two.this is the longest review i have written for a godfather movie ü§Ø 
6737  Uhh... I don't own the recut CODA version of the film, so the theatrical cut will have to do, and...I can say whatever I want about this film as long as I rated the first 2 extremely highly right? Well I'm doing it anyway: it's fine enough - I mean nobody's going to pout because I consider this to easily be the worst of the trilogy - but it's biggest weakness is that it felt more plot driven than‚Ä¶  
6738 Imagine spending your Saturday watching The Godfather trilogy in one sitting. What a day I‚Äôm exhausted but.. WORTH IT! 
6739  This is the Coda cut of Godfather III, which I have never seen before, so I will withhold my previous judgment that, as a big, freewheeling, worldwide organized crime picture, this is decent enough, but as a Godfather movie, it is multifaceted, in that it both sucks, and blows.Oh, it starts off promisingly enough, with Michael agreeing to meet with a banker from the Vatican who has made a few bad investments, and now stands to get himself excommunicated‚Ä¶  
6740  Updated from the note I made on Tuesday‚Ä¶¬†Watched The Coda Edition today at theater, and I can see why this gets regarded as the weakest in the trilogy. Although I found more issues with the second film than the vast majority of people do, this one just fails to reach the precedent sent by its predecessors. It starts off promising, and Andy Garcia‚Äôs character is quite intriguing, I really liked the scene where he tends off the house intruders‚Ä¶

6742  Finishing up my rewatch now that I have the 4K UHD remaster set.This is the recut version of The Godfather Part 3 (titled The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone)This was always the weakest link in the stellar Godfather trilogy. I never thought it was a bad movie (though there are some not so great elements to it such as Sophia Coppola‚Ä¶ she is a great director. Not so great as an actor. At least not at‚Ä¶  
6743 People often unfairly blame the shortcomings of Godfather 3 entirely on Sofia Coppola's performance. They're not looking at the bigger picture. The whole damn trilogy is about the patriarch's rise and the nepotism involved in selecting a successor. According to IMDb she played a different role in each film including the titular Michael Corleone as a baby. She started as an Easter egg and was fertilzed into an Easter embryo. 
6744 Haven't seen this film but wanna give it a review as im 3rd person in the world to review it. 
6745  (Edit: It seems Letterboxd has removed the Coda version of The Godfather 3 so what I said below no longer makes sense. Now this entry shows up under the original Godfather 3, not the Coda version that no longer exists)How was I not aware that a recut version of The Godfather Part 3 got released in 2020 and how am I only the 2nd person on Letterboxd to log it.Also, why can't I find the original 1990 version‚Ä¶  
6746 Rewatch üö®It‚Äôs a very peculiar film. At some points I think it‚Äôs good but others I think that‚Äôs as so pointless. Obviously I and everyone else knows this isn‚Äôt as good as the first two so not comparing it to those, it‚Äôs still a decent film. 
6747  Although it‚Äôs clearly a step below the first two in terms of the storyline, overall writing and general stuff like that and also some of the plot points in this movie are downright ridiculous (everything to do with John Paul the 1st), I still think The Godfather III is excellent and severely underrated.¬†The whole opera sequence at the end is some of the best stuff in the whole trilogy. Al Pacino is great as always, Andy Garcia is good‚Ä¶  
6748 I know it‚Äôs part of the first two and I appreciate the effort made here. It‚Äôs a dark phase for me here and ending just breaks me like damn, this is a great movie with a big blow. Andy Garcia and Sofia were just lovely here. 
6749  I think I like it more than I did after this second watch (only watched coda version twice) ¬†on the cinema screen, and I can even tolerate the performance by Sofia Coppola üòÇ. Overall the third episode is not bad, but compared with the first and second ones, it is indeed not that good, but the story feels natural. This rise and fall of the Corleone family is destined since the beginning. Really love so many scenes in part III‚Ä¶  
6750 Definitely not as good as one and two but still a classic in its own. Glad they stopped here because even in this one the story started to get a little outlandish. I wish they would‚Äôve killed off the worst acting ever sooner but I‚Äôm glad they got to it eventually. Use your imagination to figure who I‚Äôm talking about. 
6751 when i fucking catch you francis ford coppola...... when i fucking get you... 
6752 Sofia Coppola do be bad actor. Really disappointing conclusion to this trilogy. It just felt so unsatisfying. 
6753 Unsure if I should review this or The Godfather Part 3 as almost no one has logged this, but damn Sofia Coppola really sucked in this, huh? At first glance, she seems fine, only awkward enough to be believable but damn her line delivery just is not it. Sadly that‚Äôs not the film‚Äôs only problem, as plot points and characters feel forced, lacking the weight of the first two films. Overall, I‚Äôm glad I watched the supposedly better version of this as it was already quite dull. 
6754  I was already a defender of the theatrical cut, but what was interesting about watching the Coda cut was how Coppola shaped it into the movie I essentially already saw. You know how you watch something and you don't always absorb every single thing every time? Most viewings of things you're taking pieces here and there and putting them together yourself, to a degree. Those moments and beats and lines, etc, that really connect the dots of how you're following‚Ä¶  
6755  Coda edition, first watch in any format, and lucky enough to see it on the big screen. Apart from not being Team Sofia (she plays it too young for me to buy Garcia's continued obsession, and to be fair, the writing of her character is probably the weakest) and it being the third-best Godfather movie, it's pretty terrific - five scenes amongst Coppola's best, some of Pacino's greatest moments (the confession of sins, my God!), the unexpected but very welcome‚Ä¶  
6756  Mario Puzo¬¥s The Godfather Coda: The death of michael Corleone...STILL SUCKSBasically, the film removes 10 minutes and adds 2. I¬¥m sorry Francis. That¬¥s not enough to save 2 and half hours of dull storytelling. The bad stuff still here: The bad dialogue, the romance between Vincent and Mary, flamboyant Joe Mantegna, the over the top killing, the helicopter scene that seems like a GTA cutscene (MY LUCKY COAT !), Godawful sound effects that looks like Goldeneye N64,‚Ä¶  
6757 THE GODFATHER CODA: THE DEATH OF MICHAEL CORLEONE¬†Never seen the original cut of this because I cherish 1 and 2 too much to willingly do so, but in a world where filmmakers like George Lucas vandalize their own films decades later in the name of ‚Äúimprovement,‚Äù it‚Äôs nice to see a take on that that actually seems to work. This hits all the right notes for a Godfather epilogue, but in¬†any case it‚Äôs still very uncomfortable that Sofia Coppola‚Äôs own father directed her in such an alarmingly horny role. 
6758  The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael CorleoneFor the record, I've always defended The Godfather: Part III and found the majority of the popular criticisms shallow. As is the case with fanbase opinions on supposedly weaker entries in popular franchises, a film can only be amazing or terrible, with no real room for nuance in-between. That's either obnoxious or reactionary. Though, with that said I think the 2020 Coda cut of this film is sort of leaning towards greatness‚Ä¶  
6759  Francis Coppola RankedThere‚Äôs a bit of good and quite a bit of bad.So The Godfather Part III got recut and re-edited and got released into theaters so I‚Äôm going to see it soon because tickets are really cheap.Now about the original version...Is Sofia Coppola horrible in her role? YesIs this movie overly long? YesIs this movie anywhere close to as good as the first two? No of course notThe whole cousin/incest relationship is‚Ä¶  
6760 Surely something has to be said about how this thing dryly meanders for two hours only to take a freaking sledgehammer to your tear-ducts during its final moments. Curious to see if Coppola‚Äôs new ‚ÄúCoda‚Äù makes the pain any worse. 
6761 THE GODFATHER CODA: The Death of Michael Corleone. This new version of the film is an extremely satisfying/tragic ending to THE GODFATHER¬†SAGA. The slight changes that were made really make the film a lot more focused and impactful. Re-watching the trilogy back to back really made me realize that this trilogy is¬†meant to be viewed as ONE EPIC story. Sequels are mostly optional. Whereas¬†THE¬†GODFATHER CODA is essential.¬†DAMNNNNNN THE¬†COPPOLA¬†KING GOT ME!-Jake Lynn 
6762 only seen the original version once as a teenager, basically don‚Äôt remember it, so this was like a first time. great movie 
6763  ‚ÄúThe Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone‚Äù feels really good as both a film on its own merits but also as a ‚ÄúGodfather‚Äù film. There are many things people dislike about the original cut of Part III, and I can safely say that lots of that has been changed significantly in this re-edit of Part III which is a lot better.But of course some things can‚Äôt be changed, such as Sofia Coppola‚Äôs widely panned performance as Mary Corleone‚Ä¶  
6764 This is like making a cookie with no baking soda. It looks like The Godfather it kinda tastes like The Godfather, but it was fundamentally fucked up from the beginning so does it matter? 
6765 While it's nowhere near as great as the first two, Part III is a decent enough conclusion, with one hell of a gut-punch finale. Pacino is excellent as always, along with the returning cast (no Duvall is a shame), while newcomers Andy Garcia did solid, and Sofia Coppola brought down the movie a bit, with her flat delivery.Really curious to see the director's cut, as I'm in the minority of liking the theatrical version. 
6766 Francis Ford Coppola dirigi√≥ a Al Pacino, Marlon Brando y Robert De Niro en esta trilog√≠a y no se pudo dar cuenta de la terrible actuaci√≥n de su hija? 
6767 Martin Scorsese‚Äôs mom making a cameo was the most entertaining part of this tbh. 
6768  "Never hate your enemies. It affects your judgement."The Godfather: Part III was not ruined by Sofia Coppola. It was ruined by weak writing and underdeveloped characters. Sofia Coppola's poor performance was merely a result of that. An unexpected cameo from Martin Scorsese's mother and incest can't even save this film from its lack of emotional depth and tiresome, convoluted narrative. The final act boasts a great set piece in the opera house. Its artfulness truly matches the elaborate and‚Ä¶  
6769 i'm hurt. hurt by how unnecessary this is, hurt by what they did to these beautiful characters, and hurt by how they ended this wonderful series. who allowed that to happen? 
6770 Hm. Definitely the worst of the trilogy. I like the first 2 "Godfather" films but I don't love them. This one I genuinely did not like.Al Pacino is great. The music is still great. I liked the first half hour and the last 5 minutes. Everything between that was boring as balls. Sofia Coppola wasn't as bad as I heard she was but still, yikes.Overall, this was just a huge bore and a lame way to end the trilogy. 
6771  La gente que no le gusta esto????? No puedo creer que tenga una puntuaci√≥n tan baja. Realmente, qu√© tiene esta que no tengan las otras dos? Es dif√≠cil superar a las dos primeras, dos de las mejores obras de la historia, pero El padrino III es el cierre justo,necesario, a tan magn√≠fica saga. Todo lo que hab√≠a sido presentado antes, se cierra perfectamente. Quiz√°s no tenga la magia y las actuaciones de las otras, faltan muchos personajes y los reemplazos‚Ä¶  
6772 I still insist The Sicilian is the true third Godfather film but this has got mad ambition at times.Easily the best aspect of it, surprisingly enough, is Connie Corleone, who's the coolest she's ever been in this saga.Also until going thru the cast for the tags for my review (force of habit), I never realised just how impressive the cast for this one was; there are the most interesting of people to be found in even the most minor of roles in this one. 
6773 OK BOOMERS!6.5/10 
6774 I haven‚Äôt seen this film in quite a while since the first two are miles better... but I honestly don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that bad that people led me to believe.Yeah Sofia Coppola‚Äôs acting sucks and the script felt rushed, but I still enjoyed it very much. 
6775 Just when I thought I was out, this movie pulls me back in! 
6776 It's not that terrible of a movie, it's just the unfortunate (and unnecessary) sequel to two classics. 
6777 they really just shouldn‚Äôt have made this movie. it‚Äôs not that they waited too long or that Sofia Coppola was terrible in this, they should just never have made it. confusing, unmemprable, anticlimactic, rambling, and an embarrassing finish to what was a perfectly rounded atoryline that was completed in the second one. 
6778 Sechzehn Jahre sp√§ter ist Al Pacino AL PACINO, und nicht mehr Michael Corleone. Und das strengt ihn offensichtlich furchtbar an - und mich auch. 
6779  The Godfather: Part III's greatest crime is being a perfectly fine film. It has all the components that made the previous two films (Willis's resonant visuals, the musical themes of Nino Rota, the massive and accomplished cast), but Coppola's approach to directing and writing is what I feel changes this film. The film lacks the spirit and energy of the previous two, on top of returning to a more linear narrative. The films of the 70s had bite, vigour, real‚Ä¶  
6780 Cartoon Al Pacino has absorbed the 70s powerhouse. Sofia constantly looks like she's going to bust out an Elvis impression. Joe Mantegna stretches for his Baby's Day Out role. Andy Garcia was a thing. Just when I thought I was out... they pull me back in 
6781 Tragedy in a pure form 
6782 Sofia Coppola was bad and didn't feel right in her role, but everything else still holds up.Part 3 features more climax and action with a gripping finale, but doesn't quite reach the grandeur of the first two.It's a very well made film and did justice in its own right. 
6783 I still feel the same way about this movie when I watched it the first time. I think it‚Äôs fine. It‚Äôs no where near the first two but it‚Äôs a nice epilogue for these characters and their story. I like it but I don‚Äôt love it. 
6784  Uhhh I mean it's alrighttttttI kinda sorta knew what I was getting into with this one based off of the majority opinion. First of all, this movie really missed Robert Duvall's presence as Tom Hagen. I know he dropped out due to salary disputes, but a familiar face would have added something positive to the film in regards to the 16 year difference between the releases of part II and part III.Next, I realize that all three films‚Ä¶  
6785 idk I think if you make the first two and then your son dies, you get to make whatever movie you want about a child dying! 
6786 the way some of your reviews made me think this is the worst film ever produced 
6787 Ending got me again. fuck sake 
6788 Der Nachz√ºgler mit einem gereiften Al Pacino der zu der Phase der Karriere in anderen Filmen st√§rker war und ein junger Andy Garcia, der aufbrausend die Geschicke an sich rei√üt. Dazu ein verkopfter Vatikan-Plot und schon haben wir ein Sequel, nach dessen Existenzberechtigung mein auch nach Jahrzehnten noch fragt. Lichtjahre von der Qualit√§t der Vorg√§nger entfernt, aber mit ausreichend DNA dieser, um die Trilogie mit einem guten Gef√ºhlt abzuschlie√üen. 
6789 When it isn't being absurd, (the helicopter scene) or pointless (the cousin romance subplot) or poorly acted (Joe Mantegna, Sofia Coppola, the list goes on) or convoluted (basically the entire plot) or amateur (the poor use of flashbacks and voiceover) The Godfather: Part III is extraordinarily boring. 
6790 Been on the watchlist for 30 years. Put it on the other day, actually really liked it. Bad news first: there's some pretty bad dialogue and some pretty bad ADR, Sofia Coppola is pretty bad. The good news: Pacino, Joe Mantegna, Eli Wallach, the cinematography, and the ending are all great. Look forward to checking out the new edit soon. 
6791  *Coda Version*Looking at this film from a glass ‚Äúhalf full‚Äù approach rather than ‚Äúhalf empty‚Äù, a mob film that brings a satisfying closure to a trilogy featuring two of the greatest crime dramas ever placed on screen. Michael Corleone is getting closer to the end and has now become haunted with his sins of the past. A distant family, Fredo‚Äôs death, the murders, old age, regrets, and a sense of being forever irredeemable even with all his money and‚Ä¶

6793 La diferencia en cuanto a las otras dos pel√≠culas se nota considerablemente, pero la calidad sigue siendo innegable.Bajo mi humilde opini√≥n:Godfather II >>> Godfather I >>> Godfather III 
6794 Yeah, Michael Corleone‚Äôs death is sad and all. But you know what‚Äôs sadder? When they show clips back-to-back in this movie of young Al Pacino and old Al Pacino. RIP young Al and his good looks üò© 
6795  I would have to agree with Francis Ford Coppola's suggestion that The Godfather: Part III be viewed as a Coda to the Godfather saga, instead of an entire third part: while it does continue the story of the Corleone family years after Michael and Kay's divorce in Part II, it is more of an ending to Michael's story than anything else: the rise and fall of Michael Corleone. Unfortunately, I have not yet had the chance to view the 2020‚Ä¶  
6796 The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone cutNot sure about the new beginning, and not sure how much it really changes, but it's definitely a more emotional experience. The wistful feel is definitely heightened here, for the better. Still has some of Coppola's most plainly beautiful (and thematically relevant!) imagery. 
6797 THE GODFATHER III - with 50% less insight and 100% more cousin fucking. 
6798  ‚ÄúWhy was I so feared, and you so loved? What was it?‚ÄùFrom the opening shots of Michael Corleone‚Äôs abandoned Tahoe lakehouse, desolate and in ruin, death lingers over every frame of this film. It infects it, like a sickness; even Al Pacino‚Äôs face appears abnormally gaunt, a death mask, the hardened and worn reflection of the man he once was, now etched with a lifetime‚Äôs worth of regret... his youth, his future, erased. In this sense, he feels far‚Ä¶  
6799  I'd already seen Part I & II not long ago so I would combine 2 weeks into one and see this insteada lot better than people give it credit forI actually enjoy this a lot more than the second one but the acting from Sophia Coppola is awful making Part II still a better pictureat first, you kinda just see Al Pacino but then he sinks into the role betterone of my favourite lines is¬†EEEEE-OOOOO, EEEEE-OOOOO‚Ä¶  
6800 Not the epic disaster some people make this out to be, but its certainly the weakest of the trilogy mostly thanks to a story that fails to be anywhere near as interesting as the previous two films. Sophia Coppollas terrible acting doesn't help either.Still, for all its short comings, it does give us one hell of a tense and brilliantly filmed final 40 minutes. 
6801 I watched The Coda version.¬†Whilst it‚Äôs nowhere near the movies it‚Äôs predecessors are, Coppola delivers a brilliant and emotionally devastating ending for Michael Corleone, who spends the movie as a regretful, older and wiser version of the ice cold bastard he became at the climax of part 2.¬†I‚Äôd agree Sophia Coppola was miscast as Mary and would‚Äôve much preferred to see original choice Winona Ryder in the role, but she‚Äôs undeserving of the savage reviews she got. 
6802  This review is for the 2020 Coda version.I expected a flaming pile of shit, but Part III was pretty great!Obviously, not as good as Part II, and doesn't touch the original, but ends up being a fantastic conclusion in my eyes. The performances are all solid, I especially loved Andy Garcia, and Coppola's direction feels a little awkward at times, but still good.

6828  I didn't expect much from this, as it's rating is so much lower than the previous two films, and that's for the best. The one redeeming quality of Coda is just to see what becomes of our beloved cast of characters, but I think it's valid to just disregard Coda altogether and have The Godfather epic end after Part II. 20-30 years have taken place and Michael as a character is now barely recognizable in Pacino's portrayal of him.

For years I thought there was only one version of Francis Ford Coppola‚Äôs The Godfather Part III (1990) until The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone (2020) was released. Well it turns out the version of the film that appears on every single home media format,¬†prior to¬†the recent¬†The Godfather 50th Anniversary Edition, is in fact a director‚Äôs cut and not the‚Ä¶

6835 70/100 
6836  Avoided watching this on my only other experience with The Godfather, but it was finally time to give it a chance. Only thing I knew going in was that Sofia Coppola‚Äôs performance was historically panned. Fortunately, I found her more flat and boring than irritating. She‚Äôs also barely featured. The movie is weaker for more reasons that don‚Äôt have anything to do with her. The biggest flaw is the lack of history or depth given to what characters remain around‚Ä¶  
6837 You know as badüòà as he is, you gotta respect one thing about Michael. He drew the line at incestüôà.

I still won‚Äôt call this a great movie, but this new cut makes it better and certainly a more watchable and emotionally satisfying experience.

6839 The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone is now a fitting finale to the saga, and even Sofia didn‚Äôt seem so bad this time around. Some of the most memorable sequences live in this film including a closing stretch as good as anything in the series. The 4K UHD versions of all three films are the ultimate presentation.

6846 Closing out my Godfather re-watch party. Easily the worst of the trilogy. I actually do not have a problem with Sofia Coppola the actress, but I found her storyline very uninteresting. Andy Garcia is easily the best part of this movie. Pacino is too much in the background in this one. Sure, he has lots of screen time, but he spends it talking about his feelings and all his regrets. Not the Michael we grew to love in the first two chapters. Final thought: The Attack of the Clones of this franchise.

I understand why people don't like Sofia but I think she's kind of perfect in her daddys-little-girl's-all-grown-up role.

6876  I watched the newly released Director's cut. I only remember the general narrative of the original, so I don't know what it is Coppola specifically changed. But since I remember being really dissapointed in Part 3, evidently something has been improved as I adored it on this rewatch. Aside from the already masterful opera sequence that was (to my memory) the only good scene of the theatrical cut, Godfather Coda is sprinkled throughout with scenes far more emotionally powerful than‚Ä¶  
6877  Watched: ‚ÄòThe Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone‚Äô¬†A blessing to have the chance of watching this movie in the theater, no matter what version. I always loved part three as a competent effort to cap the trilogy. I still think the same after watching this ‚Äúnew‚Äù version that for me, produced the same effect, no big difference except for:PRO: a shorter length (around 150 minutes). That would have been a sin for part 1 or part 2,‚Ä¶  
6878  This was much better than I remembered, although to be fair, I hadn't seen this since high school and didn't remember much about it other than it being kind of disappointing and Sofia Coppola not being much of an actress. But revisiting it now, especially having recently rewatched the first two, it's a really great yarn hampered by some questionable casting decisions and an odd choice not to lean into the 1979 setting (it has to be 1979 because of‚Ä¶  
6879  The Godfather Part III is not as bad as many make it out to be. That said, with the amount of talent in front of and behind the camera, this has no excuse for not living up to the original. Pacino is still great, as are newcomers Andy Garc√≠a and Eli Wallach, but the plot gets needlessly convoluted and excessively boring at times. Had the film taken more time to let Michael Corleone reflect on his sins and his mortality‚Ä¶  
6880  Che no entiendo porque esta es la m√°s ‚Äúhateada‚Äù del padrino, en mi m√°s sincera opini√≥n me pareci√≥ casi igual de buena que las dem√°s. Me gust√≥ much√≠simo como Michael trataba de limpiar todo el nombre de la familia con ayuda de la iglesia, el conflicto que tiene es muy bueno. Y ver como su personaje en cada peli va decayendo m√°s y m√°s, maravilloso, tiene un desarrollo de la concha de la lora. Al Pacino es de lo mejor‚Ä¶

6883 Narratively this films still got it going on. ¬†It‚Äôs still got that Coppola gleam.But it‚Äôs messy. Unfortunately, he rests far too much of the burden of the film on Andy Garcia‚Äôs shoulders. He just can‚Äôt carry it. Let‚Äôs not even get into how awful Sofia is...Al Pacino still brings it though! 
6884  The Godfather and The Godfather II work together so well, as they actively want you to compare them to one another to be seen as a singular story. Similar scenes take place but with different characters, but the outcome isn‚Äôt the same. From that, you learn how different Michael and Vito are as leaders.The constant back and forth between a younger Vito and Michael in The Godfather II also incites you to compare them, and remember the original. They‚Ä¶  
6885  Maybe if this wasn't the end of an epic trilogy I would like this more. As somebody who really loves the first two Godfather movies, I can't deny that this has several of the pieces of those movies that makes them great. The cast that returns for this film is still phenomenal (i.e. Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, etc), and Andy Garcia is a great addition to the cast. Any scenes that primarily are focused on these characters in‚Ä¶  
6886 So strange to see this after growing up in a home and culture that only acknowledged the first two. I don't think it's a disaster but it's certainly lacking a lot of thematic resonance. Andy Garcia is having a lot of fun and Diane Keaton gets to have like one scene where she's good. Overall I understand why we don't really talk about this 
6887 Anyone who says that Sofia isn‚Äôt good in this has to fight me. 
6888  The first time I saw The Godfather and The Godfather Part II, I was about 8 years old. Yeah, I can see you judging that. I‚Äôm Italian, these movies are basically bedtime stories for all the ragazzos and ragazzas. At the time, my parents skipped this one and never showed it to me.I now know why. It‚Äôs a deeply disappointing follow up, but not because it was without potential. It had potential as an epilogue for this series: Michael‚Äôs‚Ä¶

6893  Once I stopped comparing it to the previous two films it became much better. It has a different tone simply because it's set in a different, more modern time. You know what, I'm comparing them now anyway lol. Where the first two films are almost a gangster high fantasy story, this has grown with its time to a dramatic action movie. It makes sense within its own context. Some parts were unnecessary and Literally nobody asked (cough inc*st) and all‚Ä¶  
6894 If Sophia Coppola really is the director people say she is, then it's a great justice she must cringe harder than I do when watching herself in this film.

6896 Kinda felt like the Return of the Jedi of the trilogy where there was a lot I liked but also a lot I disliked. Also found the pacing in this one to be a lot worse compared to the first two as well. 
6897 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   I first saw The Godfather: Part III back in 1990 or '91. Like most people, I disliked it. As a younger viewer, I found it hard not to compare it to The Godfather (1972) and The Godfather: Part II (1974), which are both five-star movies. And, honestly, it should be compared: it's part of the same series with the same actors and the same director.Watching it now, thirty years later, I find that I like it better, although it's‚Ä¶   
6898  This movie frustrates me. There are various scenes and moments that occur in this movie that are genuinely pretty good. But this movie just goes on for way too long, and it honestly feels like a lot of the cast is kind of phoning it in for like half of the runtime. Pacino gives a mixed performance here, and honestly, that was the most disappointing thing for me after seeing his masterful portrayal of Micheal Corleone in the previous two‚Ä¶

6904 An embarrassment Worth sticking around for Donal Donnelly's few scenes, finding out just how bad Sophia Coppola is, and a surprisingly excellent opera sequence; otherwise meandering, aimless, and soulless. 
6905 You know that scene in Texas ChainSaw 3D (2013) when Daddario‚Äôs character says, ‚ÄúDo your thing, cus‚Äô‚Äù You get what I mean.¬†It is technically a decently made film, but following up one of the greatest films and one of the greatest sequels was never going to work out.¬†However, that ending was amazing and a fitting end to The Godfather Trilogy.Edit: I just looked and this is my 300th diary entry. Fitting. 
6906 i loved every single bit of this movie for all the wrong reasons 
6907  Looking at this film after the previous installments makes this movie very very weak. Looking at it as a film, it's actually a fantastic piece. It is not as good as the first one by a long shot but it really is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy. The end actually made me enjoy the movie more than I had before. It did tend to seem to drag out at times, but I looked that over for the quality of‚Ä¶  
6908  "Just when I thought I was out... they pull me back in."- Michael CorleoneAfter two perfect films and a sixteen year gap we got The Godfather Part III. I used to love this film almost as much as the first two, but had a falling out with it last year. Now after about a year I decided to give it another chance. Unfortunately it was even worse this time. To be honest, I doubt I'll ever watch this film‚Ä¶  
6909 Very possibly one of the most misunderstood films of any age, so many of its component parts impress in their own right and by normal standards would be considered favourably. However, good just isn't good enough when following as it does two of the most lasting and vital works of all American cinema. It is, though, the film Coppola envisioned and though it is sadly never good enough to overcome its numerous flaws, there is a thoughtfulness that runs throughout that still manages to stir the soul, culminating in the inevitably wrenching fate for its condemned protagonist. 
6910  I'd say this is slightly better than the second film by having a simpler narrative and some killer set pieces (like that crazy helicopter assassination) but not by much. Despite being the shortest of the the trilogy (especially in the Coda cut I watched), it still suffers from the aimlessness of Part 2 had, though thankfully is free of all the flashback stuff. As expected, this is also a really lavish looking picture and it ends strongly but yeesh, the‚Ä¶

6912  (Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone cut)I only saw Part III once, in my 20s, and remember liking it, it also that it dragged. Starting the Coda cut with the Vatican Bank meeting was a great move, and overall this cut felt like it had better velocity and consistency throughout. But even without the recut, this is still great! If you can just resist the urge to compare it to two of the greatest movies ever made, it stands‚Ä¶

6930  *watched 2020 cut*Okay so my main thing here is this is really not that bad. ¬†This film commits to an idea from the very get-go with Michael‚Äôs character that I think is debatable and Pacino‚Äôs performance does not really even resemble his work in the 70s. ¬†Yet the strange, messy, sometimes even verging on pathetic, energy that creates actually almost suits the last gasps of the shell that Michael became in the previous films. Yeah seeing Michael try‚Ä¶  
6931 It‚Äôs not that bad 
6932 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   This definitely has to be my most unpopular opinion‚Ä¶I actually enjoyed this movie a lot more than I expected to. And I might be biased considering Michael Corleone is my favorite character in all of cinema, and I think this movie is a perfect ending to his character.I‚Äôve always loved comparing the characters between Michael and his father Vito Corleone. Both are similar and different. This is more explored in The Godfather Part 2 where basically Vito and‚Ä¶   
6933  Godfather Parts 1-3 = Dante's Divine Comedy in reverse.Godfather 3 Inferno. Also the one most directly involving Mother Church and her sinful hierarchy! Many of whom, according to reliable sanctified witnesses, end up burning in hellfire. To whom much is given much is required. Michael has lost everything at the end, all his love and joy is gone. A fine image of the damned.Godfather 2 Purgatorio. It gets bleaker. Entering Hell's very gate and abandoning all hope, indeed.‚Ä¶  
6934 Nope. Some great scenes but never congeals into a fully satisfying experience. Coda version doesn't noticeably improve things. 
6935 Estaba ya sentado en mi butaca cuando entra un padre con dos chiquillos peque√±os, me he quedado flipando pensando "¬øUn poco pronto para llevar a tus hijos a ver El Padrino, no?". En cuanto ha empezado a sonar la m√≠tica sinton√≠a, el padre ha exclamado un sonoro y c√≥mico "¬°Co√±o, esta no es la sala 8!"Estoy seguro de que si por el fuese se habr√≠a quedado en la sala 9. 
6936 Part 3 von DER PATE hat es einfach mega schwer mit den beiden Vorg√§ngern mitzuhalten. Genau das schafft er n√§mlich auch nicht, aber das ist im direkten Vergleich schon meckern auf h√∂chstem Niveau. Die ersten beiden z√§hlen zum besten was jemals aus der Mafiafilm Ecke hervorgerufen wurde.Trotz allem rundet Teil 3 die Trilogie gut ab. "Perfekt" abrunden w√§re wohl eine zu gro√üe Mammutaufgabe gewesen.Der Charme "von damals" fehlt einfach, genau wie die vielen tollen Charaktere, was aber auch der Storyline geschuldet ist. Am Ende bleibt ein guter Mafia-Polit-Thriller mit einem abermals sensationellen Al Pacino.Was f√ºr eine geile Filmreihe! 
6937  Ja ok, also so mies war das jetzt auch nicht. Ich finde auch THE GODFATHER PART III ist immer noch ein solider Film. Zwar dr√§ngte sich mir die ganze Zeit √ºber der Eindruck auf, dass es diesen Teil nun definitiv nicht gebraucht h√§tte, schlie√ülich fand ich, dass Teil 2 bereits ein sehr sch√∂nes Ende gefunden hat aber nun ja, nun haben wir eben Teil 3, der durchaus auch noch einmal einen sch√∂nen (gleichzeitig aber auch √ºberhasteten) Schlusspunkt bietet. THE GODFATHER‚Ä¶  
6938 um chile anyways so 
6939 i really couldn‚Äôt get my mind off how fucking hot al pacino is in this movie 
6940  The weakest out of the trilogy, but that‚Äôs not saying much. Contains some questionable character decisions and acting, but just like it‚Äôs precedors, it is absorbing and endlessly entertaining. It brings up a lot of interesting themes like the corruptness of the catholic church and government, forgiveness, and regret and while it doesn‚Äôt expand upon all of them, it does enough to leave an impression. Gets a lot of undeserved hate for being ‚Äúunnecessary‚Äù, but if you loved the first‚Ä¶  
6941 i don‚Äôt know, i just liked it a lot ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
6942  original cut. i am unbelievably distraught that winona ryder did not play the role of mary corleone. i thought sofia coppola was picked as a sheer nepotism pick, but to think she was the backup after WINONA RYDER had to drop out!? a travesty of the highest order. the movie would still be weak regardless, but at least ryder would've brought something to the table. it's astounding how bad sofia coppola is in this. i always figured those criticisms were‚Ä¶

6944  Fuck knows what films I like these days. Should make a list of films I've chopped and changed my mind on. Anyhow, this fails to match the first two parts and is not even a great film in its own right.It has the acting grandiose, well with one obvious outlier, and style of the first two. I also found it pretty engaging for the first two hours. Again, however I didn't find it as engaging as the first two.‚Ä¶  
6945  Coda: The Death of Michael CorleoneI haven‚Äôt seen the original cut since I don‚Äôt even know how long at this point, but wow, it‚Äôs really impressive just how much life this alternative edit of the movie breathes into the overall experience. I still have a ton of flaws with the movie and I think it‚Äôs still easily the weakest of the trilogy, by a LOT, but I genuinely think this has some of the best moments of the series‚Ä¶  
6946  The main problem here is Coppola doesn‚Äôt seem to know why this film has to exist other than to stop even worse directors having a go. Pacino is in his full Limpy‚Äôs Got Cancer style of performance, and the whole thing is weirdly prescient of The Phantom Menace - the work of a man who used to be able to do this with apparent ease, now constantly second guessing himself and forgetting how to do basic story beats. It feels‚Ä¶

Sure, I'd heard the third entry was less than favourable, but watching the re-cut version‚Ä¶  
6949 People dislike this for what it isn‚Äôt instead of what it is 
6950 I finished the trilogy. Awesome movies 
6951 sofia served cunt idc 
6952 Coda CutDefinitely the worst of the trilogy but still a great end to Michael Corleone‚Äôs story 
6953  The scenes that felt most like the first two films were Michael showing Kay around in Sicily. The door that first Al Neri and then Michael himself closed on Kay at the end of The Godfather and The Godfather 2 opened again but only this time Michael was on the other side with her. A little later when the door opened from outside and Michael walked out, Kay knew. She knew he hadn‚Äôt changed and never would. He never could‚Äôve.‚Ä¶  
6954  This movie honestly just felt like when a TV shows Finale takes place several years later & you see where everyone is at but here, it‚Äôs dragged out for 2 and a half hours with no real plot & due to the film being called ‚ÄúThe Death of Micheal Corleone‚Äù you spend the whole film waiting for Micheal Corleone‚Äôs death. The ending was so shocking & sudden, I nearly cried & no I haven‚Äôt seen this one before, only the first two. After watching‚Ä¶  
6955  Definitely the weakest one but not as bad as you all make it out to be. Michael's character development in this whole franchise is one of the best things about it but honestly they really ruined his character in this one. I honestly found Vincent's character to be a really cool addition and honestly wish we seen more of him.The final 20 minutes of this film was absolutely mayhem as the rest of these films go the body count‚Ä¶  
6956 This is not a bad movie. This movie is just bad in comparison to the first and second movie, therefore this movie shouldn‚Äôt exist and they should have just stopped after Part II. 
6957 el grito de al pacino me destroz√≥ la vida :( 
6958 Coda: The Death of Michael CorleoneUnfortunately do think this is the worst of the trilogy, but not by any significant margin. Has the best scene out of all of them too, the Opera climax is Coppola at the peak of his sequencing & crafting of images. Pacino‚Äôs blood curdling scream on the opera-house stairs probably his best work outside of Heat. Can‚Äôt comment if it‚Äôs critical reception was right or wrong at the time because I haven‚Äôt seen the theatrical cut, but I reallt doubt it‚Äôs significantly worse than this. 
6959 who decided these movies needed an incest plot 
6960  Yeesh. Making this was a bit of a misfire, eh? Major vanity project vibes. It lacks the compelling character beats of the first two parts that creates the stakes in those stories. In Part III, it feels like the remaining Corleones had their personalities stripped and were put in a blender with a daytime soap and a Dan Brown novel. The result is a chunky and indulgent sludge.I watched the new Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone cut, which‚Ä¶  
6961 Pretty entertaining, but Sofia Coppola's acting weighs the film down like a pair of cement shoes. 
6962 Watched the Coda cut. This film is not at all as bad what people say it is. It obviously does not come close to its predecessors but it‚Äôs a pretty satisfying ending to the trilogy. I would say my main criticisms are it doesn‚Äôt really feel like a Godfather film that the first two have and the plot is very messy, though there is some great scenes especially the ending opera segment. I feel like Al Pacino‚Äôs acting style that changed in the 80s kind of made Michael Corleone less menacing or that he just got older. 
6963 Provavelmente o √°pice do Coppola. Considero o mais lac√¥nico dos tr√™s, essa condensa√ß√£o que o Coppola faz em cada cena revisitando o legado Corleone (In√≠cio e Fim) √© a base do filme, o mais reflexivo dos tr√™s, tem um completo ar de fracasso numa intensa melancolia em cenas isoladas. Compreende passado e futuro como ciclo eterno, onde pra Michael, viver √© um cont√≠nuo sofrimento. E os minutos finais s√£o aterradores. 
6964 O filme come√ßa meio arrastado e sem muito prop√≥sito, mas melhora e entrega um final muito bom. Por√©m, √© mais chato que os dois antecessores, n√£o tendo uma trama que interessa muito. Al√©m daquele casalzinho ruim pra cacete, que estraga o filme... 
6965 The Godfather Coda: The death of Michael Corleone (158 minutos) (2020)Sin duda es la pel√≠cula m√°s sobre odiada de la historia, si, no est√° al nivel de las primeras dos, pero est√° lejos de ser la basura que muchos dicen, al menos esta nueva versi√≥n.Tiene sus bajos, pero los momentos altos son incre√≠bles, y ese final, es el mejor final que se le pudo dar a esta saga.Que personaje tan maravilloso que es Michael, el h√©roe que se volvi√≥ villano para redimirse al final de su vida. 
6966 This Extremely Tardy Sequel was released 16 years after Godfather II.¬†SIWICO (Saw It When It Came Out). Coppola recut it in 2020. Need to revisit! 
6967 We went from masterpiece, to another masterpiece, to a massive downgrade.Not bad, not good, just average 
6968 SOFIA INNOCENT!!!!! 
6969 I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs as bad as some people have said. It‚Äôs definitely the weakest out of the three (in my opinion) but it‚Äôs still quite good. I found it to be pretty entertaining.¬†There were many things that bothered me, but the incest love story didn‚Äôt really need to happen and made it quite weird. Especially as it‚Äôs the director‚Äôs own daughter. 
6970  English part belowEpilog-Version/SchnittfassungGefiel mir besser als Teil 2. Die Story interessiert mich mehr, da auch vom Stil mal gezwungenerma√üen etwas anders und es gibt keine Flashbacks die kein Mensch braucht.Ja es fehlt das episch-perfekte von Teil 1, wo jedes erz√§hlerische und handwerkliche Rad perfekt ineinandergreift und ja, auch ich habe meine Probleme mit Sofia Coppola. Durch den neuen Schnitt soll es kein wirklicher dritter Teil sein, sondern als eben titalgebender Epilog herhalten und als dieser passt er‚Ä¶  
6971 i think the pressure of following two of the greatest films of all time is real. it feels like they were trying to reverse engineer a godfather movie, rather than make a good movie that can stand on its own. it‚Äôs overwritten and the directing is uninspired. it has none of the economy or efficiency of the original films. pacino and andy garcia find something interesting, but besides that there isn‚Äôt much else. the godfather and the 90s did not make a good match.

6973 thank god this movie isn‚Äôt real 
6974 smoking on that joey zasa pack 
6975  So this isn't so much a bad movie as it is a who-actually-gives-a-fuck-at-this-point kind of movie. All the FFC and Gordon Willis stuff is still super solid, I particularly find the way Willis naturally shoots Rome in the last third of the movie to be some phenomenal cinematography. As far as new characters, I pretty much only resonated towards Eli Wallace's character and I even warmed on Andy Garcia. Won't pummel it too much, but I'm glad Sophia Coppola found‚Ä¶  
6976 4K screening of the new CODA cut. FIrst time viewing for the boys. 
6977  (Original Theatrical Cut from the 4K Ultra HD Trilogy Collection)I have to start with this. This is so far from the absolute disaster everyone made it to be. That doesn‚Äôt mean there aren‚Äôt any flaws because there are plenty. When compared to two of the greatest films ever made then yes, it‚Äôs a huge disappointment. But I don't think it's a bad filmSofia Coppola‚Äôs performance is as bad as everyone said it was. But it far from ruins‚Ä¶  
6978  One of the most frustratingly fascinating films I've seen in a while. For every truly incredible scene (the opera sequence and to be honest, everything to do with Michael Corleone here), it's also met with some utterly bizarre writing decisions and a lack of polish seen in the first two films. Sofia Coppola's performance I don't think is as bad as many make her out to be but she suffers from a completely flat character that lacks the emotional weight‚Ä¶

6980  The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone¬†The third and final Godfather movie is a grand, poetic opera full of powerhouse performances and a rich tapestry of visuals that feel destined to imprint on my mind forever (no, I‚Äôm not talking about that awful helicopter shot) but unfortunately, its let down by an underwhelming plot that strays too far from the core of what made the first two Godfather films such iconic masterpieces.Francis Ford Coppola‚Äôs decision to reframe‚Ä¶  
6981  You know, without Sofia Coppola‚Äôs performance, with a few changes‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs something here. I watched the Coda version, a supposedly better edit of this film, but all I felt is a greater appreciation for the first two films. What was so great about the story of The Godfather was the journey, how Michael Corleone went from a reluctant successor to someone to be feared to someone all-powerful (but all alone). That was concluded, though, with Part II, so what we‚Ä¶  
6982  Two screens: The Godfather, Part III/Mario Puzo‚Äôs The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone‚ÄúIs it happening again?‚Äù‚ÄúNot like that, sweetie.‚ÄùShould I log this twice? I mean, I did technically watch two movies, just simultaneously. I rigged up two monitors, one playing The Godfather, Part III and the other playing The Godfather, Coda. I watched them in synch, occasionally pausing one so that the other would catch up.The most important observation here is the most obvious.‚Ä¶  
6983 Well I can now say I'm one of those anoying film snobs who's seen all 3 godfather movies in the theatre.NGL for the second half of this I couldn't understand what was going on so will some it up like this(Screams in Italian), something something incest, it was the popeAnd that's about all I got from it 
6984 Remontage ou pas √ßa joue quand m√™me tjr mal. Je dirai pas que pacino joue mal mais son jeu est devenu plus extravagant ce qui d√©note compl√®tement avec le Michael tout en retenu des premiers films.Toute la s√©quence de l'op√©ra est absolument immense et rehausse le niveau global du film(qui partait mal) 
6985  Mario Puzo's The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone√âsta versi√≥n de El Padrino Parte III es exactamente la misma historia pero con un par de escenas fuera y otras reacomodadas. La pel√≠cula no siento que mejore o empeore la versi√≥n vieja; ambas son buenas y tiene sus propios defectos y virtudes. Lo que a √©sta se le agrega es m√°s bien un nuevo significado, que est√° en el final. Se llama La Muerte de Michael Corleone no por‚Ä¶  
6986  This was alright. Mediocre. Sofia Coppola sucks, Andy Garcia is mid, and the lack of Robert Duvall is upsetting. The grand and intricate plot line is nice and I love seeing Michael Corleone actually dealing with his greatest sin along with his ex-wife troubles, but Vincent‚Äôs story is ehhh to me; he constantly fades in and out of focus and by the end I don‚Äôt really care about him because he‚Äôs nearly absent from the otherwise incredible opera house assassination‚Ä¶  
6987 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   The Godfather Part 3 polarised me a bit. So,¬†I‚Äôm a big fan of The first two Godfather with them both being in my top ten favourite movies and The Godfather Part 2 is in my opinion the best sequel of all time. The Godfather Part 3 has some great things in it but also some inconsistencies in the story but I‚Äôll start with the things this film did brilliantly. This film features one of the best endings to a film‚Ä¶

There‚Äôs nothing I can say about the first two parts that‚Äôs negative, they‚Äôre both perfect in my opinion, and following those two films, especially after 16 years, was a hard task to complete. While it didn‚Äôt even get close to reaching the stature of the first two, there were a few redeeming qualities that I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶

6991 This was so good I wish Italians were real CODA cut 
6992 Watched the directors cut, it‚Äôs basically the same movie. The theatrical cut is better in my opinion. 
6993 WHATEVER SHE WANTS, WAATHEVER SHE WANTS, WATHEVER SHE WANTSthe she in question? sofia coppola 
6994 I want Vincent to bite my ear until it bleeds and call me sweetie.Also I liked the film. sue me. 
6995  first time watching it in over three years and i remember why i don‚Äôt watch it as often as the first two films. it‚Äôs not good, but it‚Äôs also not bad. the best scenes were the ones that drew back from the two previous films, making us feel nostalgic. other than al pacino‚Äôs performance, everything else felt flat. the heart of the first two films vanished and we‚Äôre left with a story that didn‚Äôt fully develop even though it was‚Ä¶  
6996 a cruel perversion of a beautiful and truthful story 
6997 Sorry Sofia, but you really sunk your own boat. There are other reasons this doesn‚Äôt reach the heights of the first two. But your statuesque performance is hand in the cookie jar proof you made the right decision to pour out your immense talent as a storyteller behind the camera instead. 
6998  Definitely the weakest film out of the trilogy, The Godfather Part III ends this epic saga with more of a fizzle than a bang as a bland story, lacklustre acting and sluggish pacing hamper this conclusive effort‚Äôs potential.There is little action or tension driving the plot forward and the few moments that pique our interest as an audience are merely rehashes of ground already covered - betrayals and business, rivals and revenge, love and lust. The main narrative of‚Ä¶  
6999  I really don't get the hate for this film to be honest. Like don't get me wrong, I know this film isn't even close to as good as the first 2, but this is still a competently made film. Now before I talk about the things I like, let me mention my 2 least favorite things about this movie. 1. Sofia Coppola is terrible in this movie. I know this isn't news to anyone, but my god is her performance‚Ä¶  
7000 "Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!" 
7001  whatever the problems with the packaging, the central narrative here ‚Äî michael aching for an empty redemption, passing the torch to the embodiment of the youthful fury that he once scorned ‚Äî is basically undeniable forme. 90‚Äôs pacino is an entirely different actor than 70‚Äôs pacino, but the film feels tailored to his hammier energy in a way a lot of late sequels don‚Äôt even bother with, and i think he‚Äôs largely superb, especially in the brutal final act.‚Ä¶  
7002  The Godfather Part III isn't a bad film but considering that it's coming off of two films that are considered by many to be two of the greatest and most influential of all time, it is a massive disappoinment and should have been much better than mediocre (or average at best). It doesn't have the same emotional involvement or investment as the previous two films.In regards to the positives, it's well made, well shot, and (mostly) well acted. I‚Ä¶  
7003  Version - Coda: The Death of Michael CorleoneThings it does well:- Michael's confession- Connie Corleone as Lady MacbethThings it sucks at:- For the first time, I truly felt Part 3 lacking in it's technical elements ( I used to be in the "it's not that bad" camp). There's a lot of convoluted plotting happening with the Catholic Church and Joey Zasza and Vincent. The storyline, as is, isn't terrible really. It references a number of‚Ä¶  
7004 Watched the Coda cut this time around, even though I barely remember what the original cut was like since I haven't seen it in so long, but this movie is good, and maybe better than it was before! The cousin storyline is kinda egregious but there's too much good stuff here for me to think it's even close to bad. 
7005 So you‚Äôre telling me that Mr. Orange was shot in the gut and was wailing in pain, but Mary Corleone is shot and is just like,,, in mild pain?????? 
7006 Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone d√ºrfte die endg√ºltig finale Fassung von Francis Ford Coppola sein. Als Anh√§nger des dritten Films fallen einem einige K√ºrzungen und Abrundungen der Handlung angenehm auf und best√§tigen, da√ü hier durchaus ein meisterhafter Abschlu√ü einer Saga vorliegt. Der Titel bezieht sich √ºbrigens nicht auf den physischen, sondern den seelischen Tod des Protagonistens in einem fulminanten Finale. 
7007  Coda cut. Trades in the previous films' injections of documentary realism with almost straight melodrama, even self reflexively acknowledging this distance from reality i.e. Visconti with the opera sequence. I genuinely love all of this push towards the operatic, Michael's diabetic attacks, screams, helicopter massacres, and all. And I LOVE the church plot, showing the vatican as corporation/ really boring bureaucracy & all that. But this gets muddled a bit for in the middle when they travel to Sicily, where we‚Ä¶  
7008  MICHAEL CORLEONE'S TRAGIC DEATHBefore starting, I must make something clear: the version I'm analyzing is the CODA. This is necessary because each person's opinion depends on which version of the movie you watch and how you read into it. It's at your discretion. In case you're wondering, the original cut has a 3.5 rating.It was obvious that anything that came after 2 such solid and acclaimed masterpieces was not going to live up to expectations, and this is‚Ä¶  
7009  CODA WATCHHaving never seen the original cut in its entirety due to its lukewarm response, I thought it was time to give this much-maligned trilogy capper a watch due to Coppolas fresh cut.The original two films are two of my favourite films of all time. What can you say about them that hasn't already been said? They're epic crime movies and two all-time classics. As we all know Part 3 falls way short of the mark. It doesn't‚Ä¶

7011  originally wrote a joke review but there are way too many bad reviews of this movie on this site so i had to be candid. this is fucking good. the pacing is considerably better than the other two movies so every complaint about length is just absurd to me. i enjoyed this a lot. it‚Äôs intense when it needs to be, patient and considerate with its slower scenes, well cut and well filmed and well acted for the most part.‚Ä¶

This version doesn‚Äôt seem¬†to fix the problems that the original has, but like the original, there‚Äôs still greatness in places here.The opening first act is still sublime - Michael being showered with gifts, honors, and awards of the highest‚Ä¶  
7017 Pellicola conclusiva della trilogia del Padrino, decisamente pi√π debole dei primi due capitoli, seppur di ottima fattura. A non convincere sono soprattutto l'interpretazione di Sofia Coppola e l'assenza del personaggio di Don Vito, malamente rimpiazzato dal Vincent Corleone di Andy Garcia. La fotografia risulta pi√π buia e il montaggio ricorre spesso alle dissolvenze incrociate. Musiche e regia ancora una volta di altissimo livello. 
7018 An improvement on the 1990 cut. It was a decent third entry into a film franchise, better then Terminator Salvation, on par with The Dark Knight Rises but always labeled as Batman Forever. This cut brings it up to the Nolan notch. The film still feels like too much of a melodrama, the pacing of the film is so much better. The reshuffling of the scenes help the film. A recommended watch.

7021  Mario Puzo's The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael CorleoneJust when I thought I was out... they pull me back in.I wished I could had gone to the cinema to watch this with my father at the big screen but we decided to stay safe at home and rented it, at the end it was fascinating to appreciate the new cut and remastered look of this movie.I don't know how much it was re-edited but I felt‚Ä¶  
7022  The Godfather Part lll is often hailed as one of the most disappointing follow ups in film. And after seeing it, I can definitely agree with most of the criticisms. While the first two films have such tight pacing, Part lll suffers from having a narrative that is too large in scope. The plot surrounding the Vatican and the Corleone‚Äôs old friends wanting their slice of the legitimate business pie just isn‚Äôt nearly as compelling as the main conspiracy plots‚Ä¶

7024  The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone. I tried to submit a separate page for it, but it's not allowed. I‚Äôm not a completist. I‚Äôve had no desire to ever watch the third one. Not after any of the dozens of viewings of the first two. Not Syl on The Sopranos constantly quoting the, ‚ÄúEvery time I try to get out line‚Äù. Bupkis. Well, except for Coppola himself making a re-edit (sure dig what he did with The Cotton‚Ä¶

7026 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   In a film with an overwritten plot, the key emotional focus of Mary Corleone is underwritten.It isn't just that Sophie Coppola isn't right for the part - she's not a great actress and is not charismatic.The problem is her character is basically pretty blah. We don't see the romance developing between her and Vincent. (Plus they keep calling each other "cousin" reminding us how icky it is)She only has 1 meaningful scene with her father. And no‚Ä¶   
7027  The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone¬†I need to watch the original cut before I give a rating, but as of now, it‚Äôs a 3.5/4 stars¬†Some of my problems with this film were Sofia Coppola‚Äôs acting (Her final line was awful), the plot wasn‚Äôt something that I would expect from a Godfather movie (And not in a good way) and the incest subplot (What were Coppola and Puzo thinking when they wrote that?)But I think it‚Äôs‚Ä¶  
7028 Certainly the weakest of the three films, however still enjoyable and entertaining in its own right. Coppola‚Äôs final instalment lacks the conviction and authenticity of the first two films which ultimately comes down to the cast in my opinion, the performances don‚Äôt quite cut it and at times the action can be a little over the top. That being said, there is still a lot to like here, especially the second half of the film and of course Mr. Pacino. 
7029  Road to CodaThe reason why Vito has a happy ending was because even under the horrible orders he gave out, the ruthless managing of his crime family, and the favoritism between people in his life, he was still loved. Vito was an honorable and lovable person, even with his disgraceful acts. Vito Corleone had a heart, he had a family, and he loved them more than anything else. Michael always promised he would never involve himself in the family‚Ä¶  
7030 The weakest of the three, but still quite good.7/10 
7031 It's a Thanksgiving Miracle. I finally over the course of the last two days have watched The Godfather movies! It is done! Joyous triumphant! Happy Turkey Day!This movie is fine though really. I understand the hate but I also understand the movie. Being largely similar to the first to establish how Michael had become Vito in the circle of the Godfather life. The only problem is, it's a very similar 2 hr and 50 min movie.I love Sofia Coppola in it though.People should just stop being angry with movies for not being as good as Jack and Jill. 
7032 I still don't want to talk about this movie but I'm so fucking excited to see the recutting that Coppola is putting together... I really hope Coda can give this trilogy the ending that it deserves. Can't believe it's only a month away!

7035  (1000th Watched Film!)I don't understand. I really don't understand.This is possibly the most baffling movie I've ever seen in my life. The plot is terrible, half of the actors are doing a shitty job, and this movie is so boring that I had trouble staying awake. You really know you fucked up when I get bored with a Godfather Film.However, the film does have some good elements, seeing as it is still a Godfather movie. Even though‚Ä¶  
7036 Es buena, pero en muchos momentos se me hizo bastante aburrida y lenta, una parte del final me parece un poco reciclada de la primera entrega. Si la comparamos con la 1 y 2, est√° a a√±os luz de ser igual de buena que ellas, pero al menos sirve para darle un final a la historia de la familia Corleone. El grito de Michael al final, ufff me dio escalofr√≠os, qu√© buena actuaci√≥n. 
7037 I had to let this sit a while. :(Al Pacino's acting is really always good huh. And idk why I thought contrary to most people but Sofia Coppola did the role just right in my eyes. It was that Vatican shit that wasn't as compelling I guess. And the characters there all looked almost entirely alike it was really confusing to watch 
7038 the godfather part II will always be the true ending to this saga. this is very mediocre to the standards set by the first two instalments, but overall it was still a good movie but it just didn‚Äôt need to be made. btw, sofia coppola‚Äôs acting is the definition of trash. 
7039  Well, that‚Äôs nepotism for ya.Scavenger Hunt #64¬†Task 18. Each year I like to watch as many Oscar-nominated films as I can before the ceremony.

Probablemente uno de los cl√≠max m√°s apote√≥sicos de la historia del cine y otra lecci√≥n magistral de Don Pacino (y ya van...), si bien con un Coppola un tanto menos inspirado que en las dos primeras partes, pero regal√°ndonos para la posteridad m√°s cine en may√∫sculas.

7042  The Godfather: Part III is too busy with being a sequel rather than its own film. It feels like the MCU equivalent of The Godfather trilogy, mostly just using its runtime referencing the previous films.It isn't all bad and Al Pacino gives a good performance as usual, but something about it felt a little off, I had a difficult time truly believing that it was the same Michael Corleone as in the other films.

7045 Good but not great, this final film of the 'Godfather' trilogy should still please the more generous fans.Review: wp.me/pat7iE-1LA 
7046  I stand by my stance that this is not as bad as many make it out to be, but it is a significant step down from its predecessors. It‚Äôs got a pretty interesting plot and good performances from it‚Äôs leads, but you spend the entire film longing for the simplicity of the original, or the emotional weight of Part II.¬†And I really love Andy Garcia‚Äôs performance (even though the character doesn‚Äôt make a ton of sense).

7049  My thought process goes like this: I rewatched The Godfather because Fathom Events is showing The Godfather Part II in theaters, so I might as well complete the trilogy.Well, the completionist in me is satisfied, but I can't say I enjoyed it much. The much-lambasted Part III is, at best, unsatisfying.

7051  Reviewed on Cinema Eclectica #225 - 100% Dinge GothamYes, you are not imaging it, I've awarded The Godfather Part III four shiny stars. Fight me. I've never believed in the bad buzz surrounding Francis Ford Coppola's sixteen-year late sequel to Part II. I will agree it's the weakest of the trilogy, and to be fair, how could it not disappoint expectations? As said, sixteen years had passed between both Part II and Part III. Automatically, Part III already disappoints‚Ä¶

7054 never thought i'd be this (üëåüèª) close to crying because of a Godfather¬†movie 
7055 Not really a fan of Coppola trying to redeem Michael Corleone in the last film of the Godfather trilogy. He is such a vicious and ruthless character in the first two films that he doesn't deserve redemption. I also was not very entertained until the last hour when shit starts to pop off. I don't think this entry is a bad film, but when compared to the first two it just isn't what I personally wanted from the finale. 
7056  68As an addition to the Godfather saga, there is no contest that this is the weakest part; the story is inferior to the rest by a long shot, everything seems hastily made (Coppola was reported to have only made the third part in order to fix the financial destruction of One from the Heart and didn't really want to make it in the first place) and extremely rushed. Yet, Coppola, reluctantly, made an interesting finale to his finest achievement,‚Ä¶  
7057 I always get shit for loving this movie, but I don't care. It's my favorite in the trilogy. So tragic, so devastating, and it completes Connie Corleone's downward spiral arc. 
7058  Viewed on Blu-rayThis is my third viewing of The Godfather Part III (1990) and the second time seeing in sequence with it's predecessors and of coarse the third instalment in the story of the Corleone family is heavily flawed but it is not a terrible movie.Those that hate The Godfather: Part III (1990) do so, I feel, due in part to Sofia Coppola's performance but there were many other influences on the film that hurt its final product‚Ä¶  
7059  I could always recognize the brilliance of the Godfather movies, but it never really clicked emotionally until now that I've seen this, the recontextualizing vantage point, their quasi-necrotic vestigial tail. The third installment is a messy, operatic dirge, more temporally contained and narratively straightforward, but more thematically sprawling, presented on an elephantine canvas that sees Michael vying for illuminatus status in an effort to seize control of the Immobiliare, plunging the epic mafia family saga into conspiracy thriller territory. The‚Ä¶  
7060  I used to not care for The Godfather III¬†because Sophia Coppola is so bad and her incestious relationship with Andy Garcia is too creepy. This time around, I have totally new reasons to not like this film.First is Al Pacino. I love the guy, but can't understand why he chose to play Michael as a super old, hunched over, crazy person. He was so good in the other Godfathers, so why is he so bad here? Second is the‚Ä¶  
7061  The final chapter in "The Godfather" trilogy is definitely the weakest, though it still remains a rather good film. However, I dare say that as a standalone feature, it has no right to exist. The only reason it does is because Michael Corleone needs an ending to his arc that throughout the previous films was always left unfinished to certain extent. He does receive a send-off and it is not really for me to decide whether it was appropriate or‚Ä¶  
7062 I don't consider this film "canon" (with a few cherry-picked exceptions) in the Godfather Saga. The "exceptions" are the moments in which Pacino is actually playing Michael Corleone (because, for most of the runtime, he's playing someone else entirely). But man, are those moments worth the price of admission. Missed opportunity.The story is ludicrous, the writing and dialogue are poor, and the supporting players aren't as memorable. This is NOT a Godfather film. However, it's not a bad film. I treat it as a standalone.Full Review 
7063  Well... It wasn't as bad as I thought it was gonna be, but still it's evident a lot of care went into crafting what was supposed to be the final chapter in this historic trilogy. Although not as groundbreaking or marvelous as the other two Godfather films, the cinematography is well realized and it's accompanied by a fantastic as usual soundtrack composed by Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola.The main problem with The Godfather Part III is the burden of‚Ä¶  
7064 BOUGHT 'WIDESCREEN' VHS TAPE üìº CHOICES VIDEO, KETTERING (24-10-97)Not a very good film as it took me two days to finish it and compared to the amazing first 2 films it felt flat, the acting was great except for Sofia Coppola who was way out of her depth, she ruined every scene she was in, an ok story but for me it was so disappointing and a sad end to this trilogy. 
7065 Das war zwar jetzt keine Qual, hat sich aber dennoch nach 170 Minuten Arbeit angef√ºhlt. Teil 1 habe ich am 03.07.2017 zuhause angeschaut und erinnere mich noch, wie anstrengend das war. Bin froh, dass ich die letzten beiden Teile im Kino anschauen konnte. Noch zufriedener bin ich aber, diese Trilogie endlich abgeschlossen zu haben. Beziehungsgeflecht- bzw. Verwandschaftsdrama-Trilogien √† la Lord oft the Rings, Star Wars oder eben The Godfather sind wirklich anstrengend. Ja, filmische Klasse und so, verstehe schon, aber boy oh boy, ist das langweilig. Da hilft auch das (leider viel zu laute) 70mm Blow-Up nur bedingt.Die Trilogie werde ich mir nie wieder anschauen. 
7066  The biggest problem with this movie, we all know about. The SECOND biggest problem with this movie is that Michael Corleone doesn‚Äôt act like Michael Corleone.¬†This is a guilt ridden old man, this is a man with internal strife and remorse. This makes no sense with the Michael Corleone we see at the end of Part II and the film does very little to explain how he got where he is.¬†The best elements of this movie are all‚Ä¶  
7067  Outside the filmography of George Lucas, I can't think of a worse recut of a great movie than Coppola's The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone. Important scenes are snipped for no reason; a meeting between Michael and the Archbishop is moved to the beginning, making it feel more like a ripoff of the original; and, most infuriating, an awful ADR line has been added with Connie screaming, "It's his diabetes!!!"... when another character literally says that in the‚Ä¶

7072  Oh boy. My expectations were minimal and I'm still astounded at just how much of a thorough fumble this is next to the first two. The cinematography, acting (not just Sofia), in particular the ridiculous overly poetic dialogue that nonetheless beats you over the head with what didn't need to be said in the other two. The classic theme kicking in after some of these scenes almost feels like an insult.And this is the new, more concise cut that‚Ä¶

7075 If Michael Corleone can't stop incest, then who can? 
7076  Competent to a tee, but criminally uninteresting. I never shared any emotional bond with this film nor do I possess any interest to see this again. The beats would lead you to believe this should be the most heartfelt Godfather film, but it ends up lacking any of the humanity of its two predecessors, replacing it with convoluted artifice. There's a handful of standout sequences - including the formulaic but meticulously staged opera house setpiece - but then The Godfather‚Ä¶  
7077 Francis Ford Coppola re-edited his stupid embarrassing movie and appeared at the beginning in front of a wall of books in his beautiful home and said Gideon you will like it.

Sorry about all the negativity.¬†Peace and love,Gideon 
7078   The Death of Michael Corleone  A colossal achievement very nearly on par with its predecessors, and only hobbled by a smattering of odd missteps. Taken as a whole, this is still a remarkably-rendered conclusion to perhaps THE great epic tragedy of the cinema. The story of the Corleone family is the story of America, it was never going to be perfect.It's somewhat inarguable that things don't quite cohere as well as they could, but I'll never condemn a film‚Ä¶

7087 A beautiful film to end the Godfather trilogy. There are wonderful scenes and segments spread throughout the entirety of this film and I still enjoy it immensely.Such a tragic and devestating ending that destroys everything Michael Corleone fought for from the first film.I havent seen the different version "The Death of Michael Corleone" but I will get the chance once I own this trilogy on 4k.Highly recommended! 
7088 Couldn‚Äôt take him seriously with his haircut 
7089  I wasn't that pessimistic heading into this because I don't hold the first two Godfather films in as high regard as most people. However, I absolutely get the hate. This is much worse than the first two movies. This is about 20 minutes shorter than Part I and 40 minutes shorter than Part II, and yet feels like the longest Godfather film. That was a very lackluster ending for Michael Corleone. Not to mention the end of the film was‚Ä¶

There‚Äôd be a murder spree greater than both god father 1 and 2 combined. That‚Äôs what this movie should have been about, Michael corleone reluctantly returning to a life of crime to make sure his dumbass kids‚Ä¶  
7092 Hadn‚Äôt seen this one in a while, I watched the original version from 1990 and well it‚Äôs not great, it just feels pointless, to me it just felt like a bad remake of the first movie. Apparently Coppola didn‚Äôt want to make this but his two previous films flopped and he needed the money, this is what you get when you make something for money instead of making it for the art of it. 
7093 There are some nice looking shots and some good ideas. There‚Äôs a lot of dumb stuff in it though with ¬†priest assassins and poison cannolis and shit. My favorite part is when a bunch of gangsters are getting shot up by a helicopter and one dude is hugging his coat and yelling ‚Äúmy lucky coat‚Äù then he gets riddled with bullets. That made me laugh. 
7094 better than i expected but just pale in comparison to the first two films which are some of the greatest works in cinema. Also this was made quite a while after the second one and i personally think its near impossible to capture that same magic when so much time has passed.CODA CUT

7097 Sophia Coppola: The Death of The Death of Michael Corleone. 
7098 I said previously that I could watch this shit all day, and honestly even at this loose bordering on ramshackle level that remains true.Pulls that great cinematic trick of unleashing a corking final thirty minutes to help you forget that it was losing you through the middle patch.¬†In the vortex of me knowing this was supposed to be a disappointment but always thinking people might be overexaggerating but also having that contrarian urge to really enjoy this , the final picture probably falls somewhere inbetween my expectations and my desires. The third best Godfather movie. 
7099  I rarely cry while watching films.I actually have this rule that if a film manages to make me cry then that film gets an automatic 5/5 star rating that I will never change no matter what, because if it manages to make me cry then it has earned that rating alongside a special place in my heart.Even if the film only manages to make me cry on first viewing and never again after that, I still won't change‚Ä¶  
7100  It‚Äôs simply not the first two films‚Ä¶I watched the re-edited version of Part III: The Godfather Coda: ‚ÄúThe Death of Michael Corleone‚Äù and I feel that is how this film works best: As a Coda to the first two Godfather films. The Godfather Coda is a fantastic film in its own right, but it truly shines as an epilogue to The Godfather duology. While it is nowhere near as good as the first two films, it delivers a lot‚Ä¶  
7101 Ok now this might be a hot take but I actually thought this was the best Godfather movie. It certainly had some bad and some ugly (boring Vatican politics being the former, cousin sex being the latter), but most of it was great which is why I‚Äôm giving it a 4.5/5.¬†This was definitely the coolest version of Michael in my opinion. I am a sucker for the ‚Äúsick and dying man is trying to redeem himself after completely destroying his own life‚Äù trope (I really need to play rdr2).¬†The conclusion was fitting, yet a haunting end his tale. Bravo Francis 
7102  Watched the CODA cut.I was so ready to like this movie. I went into it sort of assuming that it was probably an actually decent film that only got hated on because of how influential and incredible the first two parts are.But... I actually do think The Godfather: Part 3 is a genuinely mediocre film. The screenplay, performances, and direction are are all paltry at best. And while there are some plot points I enjoyed, I was ultimately‚Ä¶  
7103  I feel Iike I‚Äôve been spending most of adult life avoiding watching this film. And, of course, it‚Äôs really not that bad. A huge drop-off in quality from the first two (the dialog in particular, just feels really clunky) and kinda unnecessary as a whole‚Ä¶but not bad! There‚Äôs a couple of great sequences (there‚Äôs also at least one sequence that feels like it‚Äôs from a Cannon movie, which is always welcome but also kind of weird in this context) and‚Ä¶  
7104 watching godfather w a man is exhausting like i dont need to you to remind me you hate every single female character when one of them shows up, at least hate on the men too! (everyone lowkey sucks except michael) (to my first statement, im kidding, i also love to criticize) (but i criticize everyone! inclusivity!!) 
7105 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   I would argue that the very notion of a third Godfather film is kind of ridiculous in the first place, but I also believe that you can make anything work if you find the right angle. Unfortunately, this is not that angle. This is catastrophically boring and soulless, we just spend nearly three hours re-litigating the same conclusion we reached at the end of the second film. Pacino, as always, is acting his heart out but he seems to be‚Ä¶   
7106 Not as bad as I‚Äôd been told for thirty something years, but the ‚Äúsexy‚Äù incestuous gnocchi making scene was too much for me. Why did they have to be cousins!!!¬†Pacino and Keaton put a lot more of their authentic selves into their characters, and their dynamic feels lived in and complicated in all the right ways. The medievalist in me loved the papal politics. Literally screamed when my girl Catherine Scorsese showed up. 
7107  Michael's attempts to finalize his shift to legitimacy are interrupted by his hothead nephew and schemers from the Old World.The story is fine. Michael buys respect through hefty Church donations but finds more than enough corruption and betrayal there to surpass his own history. We get some guilt over killing Fredo (though really not enough) and trouble rising up from Sonny's indiscretions. There's deception and bloodshed and enough old Italian Dons to keep me slightly confused.While rewatching parts‚Ä¶  
7108 Disappointing¬†The movie was boring , and it had his moments but it‚Äôs mid tier.And there was no vibe of the godfather so‚Ä¶ 
7109 feels like a caricature of the previous ones. you can tell that the goal was to make this feel like the previous two, but no one cared if the end product was actually good.¬†i dont understand the michael's apprentice character at all. unclear why michael gave him so much attention, and the guy who played him gave a painfully lackluster performance.im happy that sofia coppola redeemed her career in other areas because this was a rough start to say the least.

7123  The Godfather and its sequel contained such an immaculately crafted, complete story, with a beginning, middle and end. It was perfect.

7125 I watched the Godfather Coda Re-Edit. Still soulless, still retcon heavy, still lacks dramatic heft and atmosphere, and emotion, and consistent performances, or a compelling plot, or a version of Michael Corleone who feels like he‚Äôs in any way connected to the man we saw before.¬†Big ol‚Äô whiff. 
7126 NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 
7127 The imagery alone in this film is just beautiful. I‚Äôm glad I approached this as a separate thing to the first two parts, and rather a history of why and what.The ending is just so heart wrenching, I just loved it. Did the empire live on?

7134 The Spider-Man 3 of Godfathers. 
7135 Can Michael Corleone stop being a whiny little bitch it's been 3 movies now 
7136  This is a let down from the first two movies. This movie just felt long and boring and keep in mind the first two were long too and The Godfather Part 2 is the longest and I consider it the best one. But the difference is that the other ones are so good it didn't even feel like it's long. If they made this at least like an hour and 20 minutes long I could have given it 3 stars‚Ä¶  
7137 " Just when I thought I was out... they pull me back in."Come on...this is a GOOD movie! The only reason I am giving this 4,5 stars is because it's not "perfect" or "epic" like the other two..I mean the plot has some really weird and annoying choices and it's slow but I think this is the right ending for the story...also the opera scene and Michael's silent scream...üôå Incredible!

7140 Hey! I wanna do something to convince you but, don‚Äôt get frightened, don‚Äôt do any sudden movements alright? Just watch me. 
7141  No film has suffered under the weight of high expectations more than The Godfather: Part III, a legacy sequel to two of the most highly regarded films of all time. The film is predominantly good with expectedly great performances from the returning cast and also newcomer Andy Garcia. The high budget is apparent in the film's incredible sets and production design and Carmine Coppola's take on Rota's impeccable score brings back all the great memories of the first two films.‚Ä¶

7150 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  This version is "straight to the point" in the first act scenes but I didn't like the ending, which leaves Michael a "living dead" as he is devastated but doesn't have the heart attack in the chair as in the original version. Still a great movie!"Poderoso Chef√£o Desfecho: A morte de Michael Corleone". Essa vers√£o √© mais direto ao ponto nas cenas iniciais mas n√£o me agradou o final, que deixa Michael um "morto em vida" j√° que demonstra estar arrasado mas n√£o ocorre o ataque card√≠aco na cadeira como na vers√£o original. Ainda √© um filma√ßo!  
7151 Why does the poster look like a Jay Z cover 
7152 Though this is not in the same ballpark as Part 1 & 2, this is still solid enough that it‚Äôs worth watching if you‚Äôre a fan of previous entries. It‚Äôs also worth noting the final half hour is definitely the strongest part of the film, providing appropriate closure to for audience.

7159  A review of The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone (and, I guess, a slightly more expanded review of my original The Godfather Part III¬†review):Francis Ford Coppola always believed a third Godfather movie would be superfluous, and after money woes forced his hand, he was proven to be entirely correct: the story felt strange and out of place in the late 70s, the timeless feel of the first two movies was replaced with something too beholden to modern‚Ä¶  
7160 i laughed when Pacino said ‚ÄúJust when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!‚Äù üòÇ 
7161  Extremely Chris Ryan voice  "INTERNATIONAL IMMOBILLIARE" Not enough is made about Andy Garcia just being on an absolute heater and Pacino honestly crushes. Clearly broken without Duvall. Would have been worlds better as a different movie, but the one we got is actually kinda good? 
7162 listen, i get peoples contention with this film and it‚Äôs placement within the trilogy. however, i still think it‚Äôs a great film albeit the weakest of the three. some shoddy performances yes (not to take away from some great ones), but i really don‚Äôt think it takes away from the viewing experience that much. mary had a great character arc despite some of sofia coppola‚Äôs acting. overall, the godfather part 3 is by no means necessary a bad film, it is a completely worthy entry and conclusion of the story. teared up a little at the final shot, coppola is really a legendary filmmaker. 
7163 What happened here??I adamantly refuse to believe that this was the same people who brought us two of the greatest films ever seen. Its slow, boring and at times just really strange (I'm looking at you random helicopter scene) Andy garcia is an awful casting and Sofia Coppolas dreadful acting made me want to turn this off as quick as humanly possible. Al pacino does his best to save this but its just not enough.Biggest dissapointment in film history?? 
7164  Finally viewing this new cut of The Godfather Part III, now titled Mario Puzo‚Äôs The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone. As Coppola has always stated, The Godfather saga is comprised of two films, Part 1 and Part 2, and the final film is an epilogue to the story.¬†The new 4K set from Paramount Pictures actually contain the theatrical cut, the 1991 recut, and this final version that was released last year.

7165  69/100Okay, it is pretty good. If you completely ignore the fact that Francis Coppola cast his own daughter into an incest storyline.Sofia Coppola is clearly the worst part of this film; but she doesn‚Äôt ruin it. She is definitely noticeably bad, but she does seem to improve a little by the end. She was a far too important character to leave in the hands of someone who doesn‚Äôt act professionally, though. This film is decently great when it‚Ä¶  
7166  The problem with this movie is that we all know it's backstage drama. We all know Coppola's financial struggle at the time, the Wynona thing, the little creative freedom, the Pacino-Duvall money problem, the lack of time for rewriting, even editing, all those things. But you know what? even with all that, the movie is actually more than good. Too convoluted? As are the other two movies, the plot is very complex and confusing most of the time in the‚Ä¶

7169  This is not a review of ‚ÄòThe Godfather Part III‚Äô, this is a review of ‚ÄòMario Puzo's The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone‚Äô, it just isn‚Äôt on Letterboxd for some bizarre reason.When I watched ‚ÄòThe Godfather‚Äô and ‚ÄòThe Godfather Part II‚Äô, I was quite stuck on how to proceed. I wanted to finish the series off, but I was well aware of all the negative reception the readily available third entry received. I knew it was this‚Ä¶  
7170  Ok don‚Äôt @ me but this movie absolutely slapped. They really said ‚Äòyou know what we need more of? Religion and DILFs.‚Äô And I, of all people, can respect that. Let me preface this by saying that I‚Äôve had quite a stressful week, and a serious, slow-paced film was NOT going to cut it. I prepared myself for nearly 3 hours of boredom and instead I got ... a trashterpiece. This film takes everything the first two films did and‚Ä¶

7176  Mario Puzo‚Äôs The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone‚ÄúI would burn in hell, to keep you safe.‚ÄùThere‚Äôs something profoundly intimate and personal in The Godfather, Part III. Coppola‚Äôs movies have always been family affairs, even if Evans and Ruddy had to cast his sister under her married name.

7177 It was nice to see Michael as an old mafia boss like Vito was. Its a good movie I don't understand why it is so hated. 
7178 it was an amazing year and a half not seeing this movie 
7179  This is a review for the Godfather: Coda the death of Michael CorleoneThe godfather: Coda the death of Michael Corleone is the worst movie in the trilogy. And I think it‚Äôs biggest failure is a lack of purpose and existence. I think another sequel would have worked for the Godfather series but I feel it does very little to earn that.¬†The new cast here is a big problem, especially Sofia Coppola, who you can see lacks a lot‚Ä¶  
7180 Damn you Letterboxd for making The Godfather the only collection left to be completed on my stats page. 
7181  [Watched the The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone‚Ä™ version]The re-edited epilogue of the Godfather movies from Francis Ford Coppola remains enjoyable to me,that fact isn‚Äôt that surprising since I never disliked the original in the first place.While Sofia Coppola‚Äôs performance is wooden and flat I think claims that it somehow derail the film is exaggerated.I still liked how introspective and meditative film this is,Michael‚Äôs reflection of the sins of his past and how it parallels his present‚Ä¶  
7182 Sofia Coppola isn't great is she? But that's alright. Andy Garcia has enough charisma to last a whole three hours. 
7183 The hate for this movie kind of throws me, I think it's a fantastic conclusion to an already perfect trilogy.It seems realistic to me on how a life of crime would make someone feel like Michael corleone and what comes with the life its such a great movie definitely the worst out of the trilogy but still a masterpiece of crime drama

7186  I watched the new cut and I think that if Francis Ford Coppola wanted to silence the critics of Sophia Coppola‚Äôs performance (who took their criticisms way too far) he should‚Äôve just added a line where someone mentions her character is an Instagram influencer who was somehow sent back to the 1970s. All the performances are off and weird in this because every scene leading up to the Mission Impossible 5 opera set piece feels like a heavily improvised rehearsal.‚Ä¶  
7187  artifice where art is the site of violence: an opera might end but the only conclusion to leaving the theater is the death of time. I haven't seen the first two installments of this story in a minute, but I've never bought the IMDB-discussion board narrative that I and II are the superior portions and this is a failure to conclude the trilogy. I think part of the readiness of this conclusion is owed to us being too invested in‚Ä¶

7190 WHACK 
7191 Godfather Coda.Better but not quite. It still suffers from a lack of the wonderful narrative restraint of the first two while somehow still trying to cram way too much (forced) resolution into everything. The acting and writing were noticeably weaker too.And the '90s just weren't a good fit for this trilogy. Quit with the close-ups. We want the wide shots lingering on dark rooms with smoking Sicilians. 
7192  Well, this was quite the left turn. It‚Äôs not as abhorrent as I had been lead to believe, as a matter of fact it‚Äôs more strange than it is outwardly ‚Äúbad.‚Äù When you adapt from a book that has such specific and novelty themes, you can only go so far with so little (especially if each film is around the three hour mark,) and knowing that makes this so much better. The Godfather: Part III feels like an unfocused project‚Ä¶  
7193 would‚Äôve gotten a 4 out of 5 if winona ryder played mary as originally planned 
7194 The first time i watched it i gave it a 3/5, with the time i started to like it more and i gave it an 3.5/5, and now that i rewatched it i like it even more so i was about to give this a 4/5 but i just realized that i already gave it a 4/5 by mistake lol 
7195 my dad made me watch this 
7196 That confession scene is cold fucking blooded man, the ending really setup The Irishman In my opinion, about getting old and realizing life has passed you by!!! 
7197 Enjoyed it more than part 2 
7198 *Original VersionNot as good as its predecessor. I still like it though. 
7199 Just like an actual confession: long-winded, a little dull, frequently embarrassing, but ultimately necessary, absolving itself for the previous films' romanticization of mafia ethics by exposing it to be as empty as the gaping hole in Pacino's silent scream. I sense circa-'90 Coppola might be on to something here in his continuous focus on the bureaucratic banality of evil within the Catholic Church‚Äîan institution not a stranger to silent screams of its own. 
7200 watched the new ‚ÄúCoda‚Äù version¬†if you thought i was gonna watch this without a BIG bowl of spaget üçù fuhgettaboutit 
7201 Que cosa triste. Es como esas bandas de los 70s que se vuelven a juntar para hacer una gira pero el baterista ya muri√≥, el tecladista se qued√≥ pelado, el cantante ya no llega a la mitad de las notas que antes pod√≠a cantar, y el guitarrista est√° muy pasado de rosca, convencido que es DIOS y puede hacer lo que quiere. Sencillamente penosa, innecesaria e indigna de la saga. 
7202 Yeah, so a huge step down from parts 1 and 2 But it was still good 
7203  Egal, in welcher neuesten Schnittfassung (hier mit einem st√§rkeren Anfang, aber einem schw√§cheren Ende) - das Gef√ºhl beschleicht einen (nach wie vor), dass die zweiteilige Michael-Corleone-Geschichte von der Illegalit√§t in die Legalit√§t, aber auch von der Familie in die Entfremdung auserz√§hlt wurde. 16 Jahre sp√§ter folgte ein viel zu kalorienarmes Dessert auf ein viel zu √ºppiges Hauptmahl. Jetzt nennt es Coppola zwar ‚ÄûEpilog‚Äú, aber irgendwie bleibt dieses ‚Äûf√ºnfte Rad am Wagen‚Äú eine √ºberlange und √ºber Geb√ºhr √ºberladene Rekapitulation gesteigerter, jedoch‚Ä¶  
7204  I don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôs possible, but I actually think this re-editing worsens the film. Usually I go about ten years in between viewings of this one but I‚Äôve seen this film twice now in the past year. And seeing it again so close to the last time really shows the rust on this one. I find this film to look incredible but it is horribly written. All the call backs to the previous films whether it be characters reprising‚Ä¶  
7205 Skull crushingly boring 
7206 the ending was spectacular, didn't really do anything other than that to make it stand out imo 
7207 The heartbreaking scream at the end is the greatest acting of Al Pacino‚Äôs life. 
7208 Aggressively mid. Also I hated the love story between Mary and Vincent, they‚Äôre literally first cousins ü§Æ 
7209 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  WHY.... serves her right to get shot omfg  
7210  I know there are a lot of opinions and feelings surrounding this film. So from the most objective standpoint I can view it through, it is a competent but entirely sloppy film. I know Coppola was rushed to make it and all that b.s. but there is still no excuse. I never felt any tension throughout this film and I didn‚Äôt care about what was happening. I can rewatch Godfather 1 and still care about each character and feel the‚Ä¶  
7211  Coda Like everyone else has already said, the changes made in the new re-edit are small but they make a world of difference. You start out situated much better in both the plot and the theme, which now reads as a broad reckoning with morality and (Catholic) guilt; the subsequent events play out more smoothly; and it ends on a more resonant note. It doesn't change the substance - it's still not on the transcendent level of the first two‚Ä¶  
7212 well at least it‚Äôs finally over now. that‚Äôs something i guess 
7213 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Trinta anos depois, Francis Coppola volta ao filme com olhar mais distanciado√â com uma ironia dupla, talvez involunt√°ria, que chega a vers√£o remasterizada, renomeada e remontada de O Poderoso Chef√£o 3, para celebrar os 30 anos do fim da saga de m√°fia mais famosa do cinema americano. Ir√¥nico porque o novo subt√≠tulo, Desfecho: A Morte de Michael Corleone, promete literalmente um ep√≠logo, uma coda (a vers√£o de cinema tinha mais esse perfil do que esta vers√£o remontada), e duplamente‚Ä¶   
7214  The Godfather: Part III always gets a bad rap simply because it's inferior to the previous two entries of the trilogy, but it's far from a bad film.It's a story centering on Don Michael Corleone's demise, as he is near retirement and looks to rekindle from his ex-wife Kay and their children. It's probably the slowest-paced film in the trilogy, but a lot of it is done with intention, as a lot of it is contributed to reflection. Al‚Ä¶  
7215 This was my first time watching the Godfather Part 3, and I personally think everyone is way too harsh to this film. I really enjoyed it, no doubt is it the weakest of the trilogy and it always had a tough job following both the previous spectacular parts of the Godfather story. I saw it is a very fitting end to the trilogy and gave Michael Corleone a rounded and complete story. 
7216  ["The Death of Michael Corleone" cut]I... kinda... liked... Sofia Coppola. I write these words without a hint of irony. She‚Äôs always been her own vibe, and that strong sense of self may not fit within the confines of the mafioso world for most, but I personally find her a breath of fresh air, even taking under consideration her problematic storyline.About the re-edit, what shines through is the reminder that Coppola is a top tier filmmaker who always delivers‚Ä¶  
7217 *THE GODFATHER CODA: THE DEATH OF MICHAEL CORLEONEThat ending had me at ‚Äúwhoa.‚Äù 
7218  This tricky, frustrating movie. Whether you call it ‚ÄúThe Godfather: Part III‚Äù or ‚ÄúMario Puzo‚Äôs The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone,‚Äù it‚Äôs hard to argue that this measures up to its predecessors. That doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs all bad, though, or at least it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs as bad as its reputation suggests. The performances are by and large quite good; Andy Garcia is terrific and makes you want to see more, and even Sofia Coppola, with the benefit‚Ä¶  
7219 I honestly don‚Äôt understand why this is referred to as the ‚Äòbad‚Äô Godfather movie. It‚Äôs probably not as memorable as the first two but it still has some really excellent moments.The opera scene was one of the best of the whole trilogy. 
7220  Jam√°s pens√© que iba a terminar llorando al terminar de ver esta trilog√≠a √©pica. Las dos primeras partes son tan perfectas que reci√©n en esta me pude emocionar y encari√±ar con la saga. Y eso es lo que sali√≥ del hecho de que no tenga la perfecci√≥n de las otras. Ahora, que tenga 3.4 de promedio en Letterboxd es una falta de respeto, me esperaba algo peor por ese rate y es mucho mejor de lo que dicen. Coincido en‚Ä¶  
7221 definitely has major issues and I‚Äôm disappointed 
7222  An opening shot of skyscraper beside church might well be the cumulative image of The Godfather. The seats of power, new and old, in contrast and collaboration. Not the rejection or revolution the American idea requires, but an evolution of ancient structures. The Church, besides for symbolic rites, is a conspicuous absence in the films previous. Here it reemerges as a representative of the highest and most judicious (‚Äòlegitimate‚Äô) protuberance of the Italian social milieu. The supreme pontiff himself, literally‚Ä¶  
7223 Not completely awful, but it sure doesn‚Äôt try to hide the fact that it was a complete cash grab 
7224  THE GODFATHER CODA: THE DEATH OF MICHAEL CORLEONEIt's been a while since I've seen The Godfather: Part III, a film I've always maintained is a better entry that it's given credit for. This is arguably the slightly better version of it, pruning it down to the essentials and providing a tighter experience overall. Without ego, Coppola has done away with the elaborate church sequence that opened the original cut, replacing it with a scene that originally came 40 minutes‚Ä¶  
7225  THE GODFATHER CODA: THE DEATH OF MICHAEL CORLEONENot quite the dramatic reworking of THE GODFATHER PART III that it was presented as. Its strengths and weaknesses are essentially the same, as there‚Äôs really only so much that you can do with the raw materials being what they are.That said, some of the editorial changes are intriguing (though most are fairly subtle). The most substantial work has been done to the opening and the finale, and while I think‚Ä¶  
7226  MARIO PUZO'S THE GODFATHER, CODA: THE DEATH OF MICHAEL CORLEONEReally not sure how to talk about this one, because I'm nowhere near perceptive enough to notice every edit nor am I smart enough to figure out why they make the end product work so much better. All I know is that it feels essentially like the same movie but clearer, more in focus. I'm able to see now the tragedy of Connie Corleone, who never had to deal with‚Ä¶  
7227  The new cut gives the series a satisfying conclusion that it didn‚Äôt necessarily have before. I‚Äôm shocked Al Pacino wasn‚Äôt nominated because his performance is really great and moving. Michael tries atoning for his sins even though he thinks he‚Äôs irredeemable. You can‚Äôt fix all the hurt and pain you‚Äôve caused but you can try to live a better life going forward. Catholic guilt is a hell of a drug. Michael‚Äôs confession even had me, a lapsed Catholic, wondering if‚Ä¶  
7228 Admirably jumps right into the story rather than spinning its‚Äô wheels for that first hour. It‚Äôs all in the pacing baby, and this moves a lot better now. Was really moved by the scene where Anthony sings to Michael and he is reminded of Apollonia, and he just breaks down. Finally the film it‚Äôs supposed to be. 
7229 I watched the Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone version so I don't know how the original version is. However, assuming they didn't change TOO much in this one, I don't understand why everyone dunks on it so hard.Weird incest plot aside, I thought this film had some very powerful ideas in relation to Michael and his search for redemption. I found it especially powerful when he gets his answer.

7232 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Review for The Godfather Coda: The Death Of Michael CorleoneI genuinely believe it is impossible to salvage this film. I‚Äôm not gonna repeat my reasoning for why I hate the original cut, but you can find my previous review if you wanna see that.

7234 This really is the greatest film ever made. 
7235 (Regarding 'The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone')If Coppola went through all the trouble of re-editing the movie, he could have at least added a CGI Marlon Brando force ghost at the end."It has the best cinematography of all three movies and yet it kind of sucks." - Eli 
7236  √áa y est, je suis un vrai cin√©phile, j'ai vu Le Parrain... les 3, bien entendu. L'aura de perfection qui planait sur les deux premiers tomes se dissipe l√©g√®rement pour ce dernier film, laissant entrevoir des personnages d√©rang√©s et inquiets, pour la premi√®re fois. Malgr√© cela, l'ambiance sublime qui pr√©c√©dait le troisi√®me volume s'invite une nouvelle fois √† l'√©cran, embellir quelque chose d√©j√† proche de la perfection.

7237  Here's the take which people need to understand-1. No amount of editing can change the fact that the Godfather Part III was an unnecessary sequel which doesn't really add anything to the original duology.2. At its core, the new edit is the same movie, however by changing the sequencing of the opening and closing scenes as well as trimming some of the fat, The Godfather Coda feels less like a bloated afterthought and more like an epilogue or‚Ä¶  
7238  everything‚Äôs so much sadder, more pathetic, more soulless, less cool, less exhilarating, less romanticised. ¬†a lifelong facade crumbling into its inevitable destruction. ¬†yet it‚Äôs still pretty damn great. ¬†does this often feel unearned, convoluted, inauthentic, and very fuckin weird? yes. ¬†is the opera/vatican climax and those last few frames some of the most tragically and beautifully affecting stuff francis ford coppola (and al pacino overall) has ever done? also yes. ¬†a moral tale of what it means to‚Ä¶  
7239 Lacks the raw power and consistency of previous entries, a problem exacerbated by some poor casting choices. Part of the problem is narrative itself; Part III inflates scale but sacrifices intimacy, and many of the parallels to previous films feel more like imitations than homages. There is still a solid structure there in the inevitable fall to accompany the gradual rise, but where Part II served as a relatable, skewed take on the American dream, the plight of an international millionaire powerbroker is less immediately empathetic. 
7240  I really enjoyed the arc Michael was given and the way in closed in the great ending, but besides that, I can‚Äôt find much else that really stood out to me in this film. It was too convoluted and long than it needed to be. The new characters introduced didn‚Äôt have anything special about them. Thankfully, the gorgeous cinematography and amazing score was still there. In my opinion, the best thing to come out of The Godfather Part III was‚Ä¶

7248  Although I wasn't in love with The Godfather or Part II, I respected the films for their artistic merits, performances and influence they had on film which is still being felt to this very day. Without those films, we wouldn't have Goodfellas, we wouldn't have The Irishman, we wouldn't have The Sopranos. We also wouldn't have this steaming turd which has absolutely no reason for existing.It's the shortest out of the three yet it feels like the longest, the‚Ä¶  
7249 yeah, this wasn‚Äôt that great but when are we gonna talk about my girl CONNIE. SHE WAS AND STILL IS THE MOMENT. HER CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT?? WE LOVE TO SEE IT!! 
7250 It‚Äôs a poisoned well and was doomed from the start (Paramount only made it because they needed money), but once you listen to Coppola‚Äôs breathtakingly honest, if a little too pro-incest, commentary track...you will enjoy the film more instead of just appreciating it‚Äôs efforts.

7252 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  The only scene I felt was truly great was at the very end when Michael reflects on all the relationships he has destroyed and dies  
7253  The Process comes to an End, once again.I wont write much about the Godfather 1 & 2 cause they are two perfect Masterpieces of Cinema every Movielover should discover for himself in my Opinion.The third Part of Coppola's Trilogy has a few Problems.It feels extremly long cause of the Combination of MUCH Religios Church Stuff and the "I'm old, I want to get Legal" Topic.Interesting, but that's the Reason why this is a very hard Watch.But‚Ä¶  
7254 Trotz der genannten M√§ngel f√ºgt sich Teil 3 der Trilogie nahtlos in dieses Epos, diese Familien-Saga der Corleones ein. Die Tragik dieser Familienchronik wird in Teil 3 sogar besonders deutlich [...].Hier geht's zur kompletten FILMSTARTS-Kritik: bit.ly/FSKritikDerPate3 
7255 There are some phenomenal scenes in here (the home invasion, Mike and Kay reminiscing in Sicily, and that tragic ending), yet there are some storylines that are just flat out weird, like the whole subplot between Andy Garcia and Sofia Coppola.¬†The definition of a mixed bag, and it really isn‚Äôt at the fault of the actors. I just think the script could have benefited from a few more drafts and the return of Robert Duvall. 
7256 Has such moments of brilliance like the Little Italy scene with Joey Zasa, but all of the International Immobiliare, Don Altobello, and Sofia Coppola scenes are disappointing. Andy Garcia and Al Pacino are fantastic, if only they had a better story. 
7257 The Godfather: "I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse."The Godfather, Part II: "It was you, Fredo, you broke my heart!"The Godfather, Part III: "Tony. Says. That. l. Am. A. Front. For. The. Foundation. That. You. Are. Using. Me. To. Pull. The. Strings."1 star for Sicily location shoot. 1 star for ZASA!!!! 
7258 michael corleone retired with his family in 1965 and lived happily in his lake home to the day of his death. this movie is just a spinoff okay? okay. 
7259 that must have been a bad cannoli 
7260 Contrary to opinion, I genuinely enjoyed this watch. From an acting perspective, I had a blast watching Garcia‚Äôs ambition, Keaton‚Äôs fragility, & Pacino‚Äôs silence. Seeing how they all progressed throughout the film only makes me realize that character development is Coppola‚Äôs scriptural strong-suit. Although it maintains the same technical strengths of its predecessors (I love you Gordon Willis), I must say it isn‚Äôt as fleshed out as they are. Still, however, in terms of subtext, there‚Äôs a lot for the audience to dwell on.I have finally crossed the Godfather trilogy off my watchlist.I love you, Coppola. 
7261  Painful. Thinking about this movie is just painful. I only expected it to be less better than the other two, but in my opinion it was a completely nonsense.The comparison is probably its worst enemy, maybe if I try to overlook the dull narrative I could see how it may be useful to understand the decline of Micheal to a lonely path of regret, but damn, we didn't need three hours of uninteresting priests messes and Sofia Coppola cringing‚Ä¶  
7262 The Simpsons referenced this trilogy a lot, but I never expected the guy who voices Fat Tony to actually originally be in one of these films. Also, they killed someone with a pair of glasses!?! 
7263  Nearly 30 years later after the first viewing, I watched this for the second time.And it is still a hodgepodge of a film.But SofiaCoppola‚Äôs performance has aged quite well I thought. Back when it came out ¬†I thought she got a bit (a lot) of a raw deal at the time even if she wasn‚Äôt all that great.Now I watch Diane Keaton and Al Pacino in this and have far more issues with them than I do‚Ä¶  
7264  Fans of cinema are positively unanimous in the lauded praise of The Godfather parts one and two. While they certainly didn‚Äôt make as much of an impact on me as I was expecting, I still appreciate the hard work put in by director Francis Ford Coppola. I‚Äôd heard rough opinions on the final instalment in the trilogy, but I‚Äôd not expected The Godfather III to be this redundantly useless. Completely devoid of point and interest, yet somehow pulls it together‚Ä¶  
7265 Props for an attemp at such a lofty scope - New York real estate monopolies that end up influencing the election of a new pope, for Christ sake - but so stagey with melodramatic violent scenes that at times it often reads like a spec script for a potential third Godfather movie written by a writer of cheap paperback thrillers. Still, Coppola still knows how to put a scene together, despite the embarrassing content. By the way, what was worse: Sofia Coppola‚Äôs acting or the cousin fucking subplot? DAS A-SPICY MEATBALL! 
7266 El punto final a mi a√±o cinematogr√°fico es, tambi√©n, la muerte de una de las mejores sagas de la historia del s√©ptimo arte. Y, la verdad, no se me ocurre mejor forma de despedir 2018.P. D.: A los que dec√≠s que es una pel√≠cula floja, que est√° a a√±os luz de las dos primeras partes, etc., probad a verla despu√©s de enlazar One From the Heart, Peggy Sue Got Married y Tucker y ya me cont√°is. 
7267  Surely, I thought, everyone was overstating how bad this is. Surely, I thought, it was just a relative letdown next to the previous two and people just couldn't handle the disparity.Nope, it's at least as terrible as everyone says, both compared to the previous installments and just all by itself. That so many have laid the blame on Sofia Coppola's acting is absurd and offensive. She's really bad, don't get me wrong, but when she's on-screen it's honestly refreshing‚Ä¶  
7268  First off, I totally understand the criticism The Godfather Part III went through being that it's a sequel to two of the magnum opus that is The Godfathers I and II. I get it, it was a huge step down. And Coppola never wanted to make a third one, stating that the story had already ended in the preceded sequel.That being said, I, too, understand how chaotic it must've been to go through production without having a focused sense‚Ä¶  
7269 Wow, there is such an obvious difference in quality between this one and the other 2. It just seems forced compared to the others. The score doesn‚Äôt have the same effect, the cinematography fails to equal its predecessors, the incest is... ew & the acting of the next generation is average. It‚Äôs still one of the best Trilogies ever bc of the 1st two but this one lacks so so much. The ending was emotionally moving but it seemed like a chore to get there. 
7270 :(I am sadI am a sad boiOn my reviews for the Godfather Part 1 and 2 I compared them to paint on a canvas and how they're both beautiful and I was going to say something funny for this one because I knew I would most likely not like itBut I didn't anticipate it would be this bad so bad in factI have become very sad :( 
7271 I bet if I watch this series a few more times I'll like this less and less. Probably pretty unnecessary, even more so when they couldn't get all the right cast together. Was really missing Duvall in this. 
7272 this was a hot mess but i'd be lying if i said i didn't thoroughly enjoy the opera hall scenes

7274 as much as i enjoy myself when i watch this movie, part of me can't help but feel offended and wildly confused at how this movie turned out. it's like francis ford coppola was purposely trying to sabotage this movie so paramount would get off his back. gives me plenty of material to rant about michael, though, as baffling as his characterization is. 
7275 Me and my cousinsAnd you and your cousinsIt‚Äôs a line that‚Äôs always running 
7276  People are too hard on this movie. Does it not live up to the original? Yes. But, just because something is disappointing doesn't make it bad, especially when you've got to live up to the reputation of "THE GODFATHER PARTS ONE AND TWO ARE THE GREATEST PIECES OF CINEMA EVER MADE". Should it have just not been made? Yes. Definitely. It does not need to exist. But, since we have it, it's a fine film. A decent story, some great‚Ä¶  
7277 Still a pretty fun movie, but you knew where this was going right from the beginning. There's only so many things they can do at this point really, and we know how Michael thinks and is going to act. It wasn't without its merits - strong acting, pretty good dramatic scenes, but like the others, man do they make long movies! Glad to have made it through all three finally, but I'm not sure I really want to revisit them any time soon.

7279 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   It's not nearly as good as the first two movies, but it remains a worthwhile epilogue that concludes Michael Corleone's story in an overall satisfactory if uneven manner.The performances remain good to great all-around. Pacino does have his occasional distracting hammy moments (Ex. Michael's first heart-attack, the yell after the death of his daughter) but still manages to shine thanks to some great dialogue. The story told in which Michael begins to contemplate and question his life while trying‚Ä¶   
7280 The opera sequence is just magical. How can anyone say this is the worst movie from the trilogy? It's just as good as the two previous ones. I guess here's a perfect example that you have to see the movie before making assumptions if you'll like it or not based on others opinions. 
7281 Quite slow paced with some bad supporting performances and one of the worst ending scnes in cinema, it still delivers a solid enough story and one of my favourite SceneS in cinema. 
7282  From CinemaShame.Wordpress.com.This has become a most unexpected slice of Shame. Having rewatched Godfather and Godfather Part II to brush up on my Corleone lore for the recently recorded Cinema Shame podcast, I kept right on rolling into Godfather Part III. Why not? The wife and I were invested, hip-deep, quoting the films and proffering our own community-theater Brando impersonations. Of course we would complete the cycle.But a funny thing happened shortly after beginning the final Godfather installment. I‚Ä¶  
7283  This move takes a lot of flack. And while there are definitely some problems with it. I don't think that it is as bad as a lot of people make it out to be. Are there some parts that are bad, absolutely. I think Sophia's performance is pretty bad. She is not a very good actress (Writer/Director yes... actress no) a lot of her scenes she seems to be trying to act and not let the actions and reactions come‚Ä¶  
7284 Well. I finished it. Honestly, this was not as bad as everyone says. The ending however left me unsatisfied. You could replace this movie with the scene from The Lion King where ghost Mufasa emerges out of the sky to talk to Simba but with Vito and Michael, and it would be more satisfying than this movie. Al Pacino was the best part of this though, and I loved the scene where he confessed his many sins and sobbed. 
7285  Paramount. Coppola Restoration Blu-Ray1.85:1Color (Technicolor)35mm15"Friends and money - oil and water"THEATRICAL CUTThe story comes full circle, we have the first and third film deal with transition and the middle film deals with the start of power. In a nutshell it works, the concept really does come together, it's not fluid as it should be when we take Coppola's previous work. However, the finale to this film is heartbreaking when we see Michael throughout‚Ä¶  
7286  With its present reputation, it takes a long time to get around to The Godfather Part III, unless of course you‚Äôre already a big fan of Coppola‚Äôs saga. I only ever wanted to watch it after refreshing myself with the first two parts, but that‚Äôs a long investment. You‚Äôve seen over 6 hours worth of film before you get around to the third, usually I‚Äôm burnt out by then. However, this time I really came around on Part II. While‚Ä¶  
7287 Michael Corleone tries to make his business legit and save what is left of his family and his life. They should have left it at the second movie because this movie is not terrible but it is slow paste and dull at parts. 
7288 I'd seen large sections of all three films many times over the years, but I FINALLY got it together enough to watch all three in order over the course of the past week. The Result: I may never be able to go to a wedding, baptism or opera again. 
7289  A definite disappointment. Almost an unnecessary film to be made. I think I would have been content with the ending of part 2. Andy Garcia is the highlight of this film; excellent job as the hot-tempered successor of Michael. Then there is the complete other end of the spectrum with Sofia Coppola, who is just awful as Michael's daughter Mary. There are still some decent themes addressed in the film, such as Michael's alienation, and Coppola's use of oranges still‚Ä¶  
7290  On previous viewings of this film I have been much more lenient towards it. I just finished watching it for I believe the 7th time and for the first time I now see it for what it really is. What is that? A good film, nothing more. Following up the first two Godfather films was obviously a tough assignment. The fact is, no matter how good this film was it probably wouldn't surpass its predecessors. Unfortunately, not only did it‚Ä¶  
7291 I like the guy that does the donkey impression, and that's about it. There is nothing really that bad about this film, though the fact that it is boring is pretty bad in and of itself. I guess I'm glad I finally watched this, but I will never watch it again.

7299  The Godfather: Part III is a rather disappointing end to the iconic trilogy. While it looks like a Godfather movie, and sounds like a Godfather movie, it is far from the standard that Francis Ford Coppola set with his first two films. I think it might be slightly over hated - but, at the end of the day, this just wasn‚Äôt an enjoyable watch. Sofia Coppola‚Äôs performance fell so flat and was so disconnected to the film as whole.

7301 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   An incredible finale to The Godfather trilogy. The Godfather Part 3 encapsulates so much of what I love about the first 2 and then adds even more to it.The portrayal of the Corleone family is more tragic than ever before. Michael is more powerful and wealthy then he ever could‚Äôve imagined in The Godfather Part 1, but he has lost almost everyone (even his one living brother seems to have been erased from the timeline) and is overrun with‚Ä¶

7309 I'm sorry this has nothing to do with the movie but the cover always makes me laugh cuz it just looks like Al's boute to lay out the most fire roast 
7310 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Other than Sofia Coppola's awkwardness pouring into Mary's character, the movie was amazing. We can genuinely see Michael's remorse and regret over what he's done in the past. He wants to fix things and he tries but he knows he can't change what happened in the past. That's so realistic and so painful to watch, the entire time watching the movie I was wondering what events led to this, maybe if Apollonia or Sonny were alive or if Vito wasn't shot, things would have been different with Michael. It's sort of sad seeing Michael die all alone, a complete parallel to Vito.  
7311 Come on, y'all, it's not that bad of a movie.

7314  Coda: The Death of Michael CorleoneIt's been 12 years since I last saw this film and I've only seen it once so I couldn't tell you the differences in the two cuts but what I can say; while I'm not the biggest fan of Part II in comparison to the first, though it is obviously excellent, if you take away the shitty romance between Mary and Vincenzo I'd put this on par with the 1974 sequel.The opera sequence,‚Ä¶  
7315 Watched the Coda cutStill the most entertaining of the trilogy by far imo. Parts one and two both have multiple moments where I'm like "how is there still an entire movie left" but not this one! Not gonna lie, if [redacted] hadn't happened, I totally would have watched a part four about Vincent and Mary. Who am I kidding though, I'd watch The Godfather part 12 about the rise of Michael Corleone's second cousin's nephew

7319 The Godfather Part 3I have finished the Godfather trilogy. I must say it was brilliant. Part 3 is the conclusion to one of the greatest trilogies of all time.Going into part 3 I have heard not great things, and I was legitimately excited to watch it. Really this movie isn't as powerful as the other two, it chooses to focus The Pope & religious commitments.The movie definitely has its moments and I liked how they continued the story & the conclusion was satisfying. I don't get why some people hate this film, it's pretty good but not as powerful as the other two.

7322 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   First things first. Does The Godfather Part III have anything on its mammoth prequels? No.But is it such an abomination to the franchise that it should be all but denounced from canon? Hell, no!In all honesty, The Godfather Part III is a pretty good film which furthers the story of Michael Corleone and in fact, provides a very important conclusion to it. While Part II left us with an ambiguous ending which despite confirming Michael's ultimate corruption still‚Ä¶

7330 "Tough guys? I don't need more tough guys. I need lawyers."Sofia Coppola is so good in this film as a boring, empty, rich girl who wants to fuck her cousin for over 3 hours. The wasp-fi-cation of the Italian American. She walked so Emma Watson in The Bling Ring (haven't seen it) could run. Excellent Catherine Scorsese cameo.

I‚Äôve always heard that this is the ‚Äúeyesore‚Äù of the trilogy. Now knowing that the intention of the movie is to be an Epilogue to the events of the first two films really puts this in perspective for me. It may not reach the heights of the other two films, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Ä¶

7335  Coda cut.¬†Living up to the utter perfection of the first two entries might not have ever been truly possible, but Part III has always felt like an epilogue, in any cutting. FFC‚Äôs final cut of the film, appropriately dubbed a Coda, fixes many problems that plagued the theatrical cut. It wisely excises the ‚Äúpreviously on‚Äù, tightens the pacing, and cuts Sofia Coppola‚Äôs performance to highlight the scenes more than the actress.

7337  Watched as The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone. To be honest it's been so long since I watched the original cut that I wasn't totally sure what the differences were‚Äîthough the new opening scene goes a long well to help the viewer understand one of the stranger plotlines of these films (International IMMOBILARE!). It's probably been 15 years since I've seen this. I would have been in college and my memory was always that it wasn't as bad‚Ä¶  
7338 just finished watching the godfathers movies.. I‚Äôm speechless. best series of movies that i have ever watched in my entire life 
7339  If Godfather 3 is really one of the worst sequels of all-time, then The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone has to be the single greatest Director's Cut salvage job in film history.This is the film all you cineastes have been battering for 30 years?Look, no-one's saying we needed a third Godfather film. But we didn't need a second either. Godfather Part 2 uses its novel story-telling structure to tell...pretty much the same story as the first‚Ä¶  
7340 The Fuller House of mob movies. Too much forced nostalgia and Andy Garcia‚Äôs character was just out of place. Pacino was great as always and Diane Keaton was excellent as Kay, just as she was in part 2. 
7341 The first time around I only watched Pt I and II, refraining from watching III at the time because everyone told me it sucked. Now 14 years later I finally watched the whole trilogy and I very much enjoyed this as well. Maybe it‚Äôs the 2020 recut, maybe it‚Äôs my extremely long build-up of expecting the worst, or maybe it‚Äôs just Pacino being fucking fantastic. Better late than never, and a great way to close out the year! 
7342 Whilst not as strong as parts 1 and 2, the coda version of part 3 was still a fine film. A fascinating exploration of a much more mellow version of Michael, his regrets and surprisingly his remorse.¬†‚ÄúJust when I thought I was out, they pull me back in,‚Äù 
7343 sorry for being annoying butttt this is the best one in the trilogy minus the super weird incest subplot. forgoes the linear feeling of the first two for something less predictable, more encompassing, and frankly just better.also sofia coppola slayed y‚Äôall r just haters‚Ä¶ 
7344  The Godfather Part 3Coda: The Death of Michael CorleoneThe cinematic equivalent of Dad Rock.Admittedly, I‚Äôve never been all that big on The Godfather movies. I see the craft, I hear the opera, I can smell the family style platters being lovingly prepared. It just isn‚Äôt my bag.¬†This is probably the best version of the material (to date lol), but I‚Äôm not sure that says a whole lot. Garcia is too goofy and daughter Sofia is on‚Ä¶  
7345  Watched the 2020 ‚ÄòCoda‚Äô cut on Channel 4 app. Whether this edit fixes anything I don‚Äôt know because it was a first time watch for me. A watch inspired by listening to Cine-Files (Steve and John) deep dive into Part II.This film would seem to get an unfair reputation. Sure it doesn‚Äôt scale the heights of the first two, but it‚Äôs still a good movie to me! Al Pacino is absolutely phenomenal. He doesn‚Äôt just bring older Al, he‚Ä¶  
7346  Watched the new Coda version. Definitely not as engaging as it's predecessors, and it's more on-the-nose (Michael *immediately* talks business after Kay lets him back into her heart) and melodramatic (Connie is walking around like a Disney evil Queen) than the first two entries. And there are some clunky moments like Michael surprising Kay in the car. Out of character much?But, still... it's as beautifully shot as the others and Pacino is just on another level here. Sofia isn't‚Ä¶

7348 what i take from this classic trilogy is that sicilian REALLY like oranges 
7349 The lightest of the trilogy. The least emotional of the trilogy. The only one in the trilogy without Vito. A different Michael from the rest of the trilogyIn comparison to the other godfather films this loses every time. But let‚Äôs be honest, it wasn‚Äôt exactly bad either 
7350 I think it‚Äôs a great film about a Godfather, but not necessarily a great Godfather film

I'm getting wiser now.Kay Corleone: The sicker you get, the wiser you get, huh?Michael Corleone: When I'm dead, I'm gonna be really smart.I'm gonna start off by immediately addressing the elephant in the room: yes, I am aware that The Godfather: Part III is a massive downgrade from its predecessors.

7353 Heartbreaking watch. The first two films are in my top 10 of all time, and going into this I was at least hoping for it to be good, but it ended up being exactly what I thought it would. Less of a Godfather sequel, and more of an adaptation, with glimpses of what could've genuinely been a great trilogy capper, but instead? We're stuck with a tame, disappointing ending to what could've been the greatest film trilogy of all time. It's unfortunate to say I gave up on it midway through, but it's simply the truth. 
7354 Actual dialogue from The Godfather: Part III. I wish this were a joke. It isn't.MARY: (played by the director's daughter) I was 8, you were 15.VINCENT: (Her character's cousin) I dunno, I had a lot of girlfriends when I was 15.MARY: 8-year-olds?VINCENT: Especially 8-year-olds. 
7355  I. LOVED. IT!!!!!! I didn't think I needed to watch it, but I'm glad I did cuz this was peak cinema to me. Maybe I AM tasteless, but I'm freeee. First of all: I gotta get it out of the way: the incest storyline was absolutely repulsive. Deserved every lashing it got and more. Every time it appeared on screen was just a huge ICK. Ew, ew, ew. I agree with the hivemind that Sofia Coppola was truly god-awful in‚Ä¶

7357  NOTE: This review, rating, and my rankings are for ‚ÄúCODA: The Death of Michael Corleone‚Äù cut of this picture. This is the preferred version that I recommend to everyone for watching this film.Well, that was‚Ä¶ disappointing.You always hear about how The Godfather: Part III doesn‚Äôt live up to the original two films, but even with that in the back of your head going into this experience you still hope for the best‚Ä¶ and still somehow wind up being‚Ä¶

7359 wow what a way to end a trilogy , Al Pacino deserves every award in my opinion 
7360 the great thing about the first two Godfathers is that they had a fantastic Tom Hagen to incest ratio (that is 1 full Tom Hagen : 0 incest). part iii... not so much 
7361 coppola casting his own daughter to play a character who has an incestuous relationship with her cousin was weird enough but imagine if he had cast nicolas cage instead of andy garcia... that would have been hilarious not gonna lie 
7362 I mean I don‚Äôt think it was THAT bad as others are saying, but it‚Äôs just not as iconic as the first two.Al Pacino‚Äôs acting however, is by far top notch in this, that I forgot everything else about the trilogy. 
7363 this film is so fucking funny. sofia coppola deserved an oscar for this not lost in translation!!! 
7364  Been putting this one off for a while because of how tepid everybody seemed about it (or downright vitriolic on Sofia Coppola‚Äòs performance‚Ä¶) WELL in my flurry of threequel watches I changed course‚Ä¶ and (of course) I ended up loving the movie. There are flaws, of which I‚Äôd attribute to the truncated production (Francis Ford Coppola had 12 months to write, direct, and edit the movie.)

7372 Pretty embarrassing, biggest issue is that they clearly wanted this to be long for the sake of being a Godfather film when the story just doesn't warrant it at all, the opera scene in the 3rd act genuinely takes the piss with how much its drawn out. Francis Ford Coppola didn't lose all of his talent though, so this still manages to be somewhat enjoyable and not terrible like some others say, but I get why everyone wants to just forget this ever existed.

7377 Underwhelming. A caricature. Hollow.Also, will never look at gnocchi the same way again. 
7378 ‚ÄúThe Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone‚Äù is an improvement on the original cut in almost every way. It‚Äôs very much the same film, and it still has many of the same flaws, but it now feels tonally closer to the other films in this trilogy.The only change that made me scratch my head a little bit is what Coppola did to the ending. But I also kind of liked it.

7384 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   "Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in."The Godfather: Part 3 is definitely very disappointing in comparison to the first two films. But I still found it to be mostly entertaining and an overall decent end to the trilogy. Now I will start out by addressing the obvious issues this movie has. Probably the most popular one being Sofia Coppola's acting. And yeah, it's not good. I didn't mind the character of Mary, but the‚Ä¶

7392 Had low expectations for this and was still left disappointed. How did things ever get so far? 
7393  (Note: I watched "Mario Puzo's The Godfather, Coda: The Death Of Michael Corleone")The fact that people really think that this film is bad is beyond me, of course, it has a slew of flaws, but you can't forget all the strong points. I have only seen this film once, and I've never seen this new cut but this version is certainly better.One of my favorite things about the trilogy is all the Shakespearean stuff, and I think this‚Ä¶  
7394  Instead of the theatrical cut this time, I decided on watching The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone, and despite the long-winded title switch, this cut is very minimal in terms of changes. It does, however, make the pacing of the entire film much better by reordering certain scenes, shortening some and just outright removing others. A lot of this does help bring the runtime down to a better length which is appreciated, especially since the original does start‚Ä¶  
7395  Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in.Before I start I just want to make it clear I watched the theatrical cut as opposed to Coda, but I do plan on watching that in the future. That being said, I understand why people don't like this one, even though I do think there's a lot to love here. It's by far the weakest of the trilogy in every aspect, and feels completely unnecessary after how‚Ä¶  
7396 it‚Äôs not that bad it‚Äôs just terrible compared to the previous ones. i‚Äôm a sucker for al and diane‚Äôs scenes in sicily unfortunately 
7397 When only one person seems to understand that incest between first cousins is not a love story, it's just wrong. 
7398 Nachdem ich nun selbst in das letzte Drittel meines Lebens einbiege, verstehe ich immer mehr warum The Godfather III nur noch wenig an die ersten beiden von Kraft und Sexappeal nur so strotzenden Teilen erinnert. So ist es halt, das Leben! 
7399 Give me Marty Scorsese's lovely mother cameo in every gangster movie or give me death 
7400 definitely would‚Äôve been fine without the incest.. 
7401  I watched the Coda version. It's shorter and a bit more concise. I got to understand it a bit better than the original version.People talked a lot about how Sofia was what "ruined" this movie. I won't put all the blame on her but in the hands of a better actress, Mary Corleone would've had a bit more depth to her other than "spoiled, little girl" maybe...? Or was it a problem with the script? I can't quite put‚Ä¶  
7402  My Informal Thoughts on The Godfather Coda:¬† It has been a few years since my last viewing of The Godfather: Part III, so I cannot give you specifics on what it is different. Frankly, I have tried to forget the 1990 sequel‚Äî‚Äîa relatable passion for many Godfather fans. Since I revisited the first two films, I thought, ‚ÄúMaybe Coppola recut and improved The Godfather: Part III?‚Äù While The Godfather Coda is less embarrassing, it is still a ridiculous, shallow,‚Ä¶  
7403 1991 Director‚Äôs CutSo the additional 8/9 minutes in this version, the cut I‚Äôm most familiar with, does enhance the overall impact of the movie for me. A handful of establishing shots helps the flow of the film whilst additional moments of dialogue and narrative, notably involving ‚ÄòMichael‚Äô and his children, provides a deeper perspective of both their relationships and those of the main characters. Watching both the theatrical release and director‚Äôs cut back sets up¬†The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone (2020) nicely, which I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing even more now.1st Review (1991 Director‚Äôs Cut)2nd Review (Theatrical Release) 
7404 This is one of those movies I want to like so bad, and there‚Äôs not really much super wrong with it but after having seen the first two and feeling the power those hold, this seems to fall flat in many aspects. Still has so nice parts tho, and even tho we‚Äôre left at pretty much the exact spot we left Michael at the end of this as we left him The Godfather Part II,¬†this does conclude the trilogy completely.

7411 TitleCoda: The Death of Michael CorleoneReleased2020SummaryThe 30th anniversary shorter 158 minutes release of the original. Reedited and reissued by director Francis Ford Coppola under the intended title Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone. Coppola calls it his definitiv and intended version being a epilogue instead of a sequel. 
7412  Original rating: 6/10.So, I did rewatch the other two Godfather films recently in the past couple of weeks but I didn't review them as I only review rewatches if I end up changing my rating.The first two are obviously fantastic and I remembered them being fantastic back when I last watched them about 9 or so years ago. This one, however, I remember not being anywhere near is good, and the general consensus seems to think the same‚Ä¶  
7413  I went in hoping to find another misunderstood and underrated 3rd entry like Halloween 3 or The Exorcist III, but this trilogy-capper lived up to its bad reputation. On its own in isolation, it's merely mediocre, but compared to the other two Godfather films, it's hot garbage, and Pacino isn't really even playing the same character. I never needed to see Michael Corleone gobbling down candy bars or see Francis Ford Coppola make his daughter who cannot act star in‚Ä¶  
7414  This is Francis Ford Coppola‚Äôs recent re-cut of his ‚ÄúGODFATHER III‚Äù, and it‚Äôs Awesome. Watch it for sure.If you know, you know, but most mofos say that this third take in this series was inferior to the previous two, made so many years before this one. But i gotta say, i dig it. It‚Äôs literally a CODA in this form. It‚Äôs an encapsulation, with perhaps some recapitulation, of the major themes and driving forces of this entire epic story,‚Ä¶

7418 seeing al pacino silently scream in agony just made me fall to my knees. his performance in this really bookends the trilogy so nicely. laser-focused on his age, and how you know he wants out of the gangster life but just can't seem to catch a break. it hurts your heart in the end, but it's supposed to.i think i understand why most people really despise this third part, but i just can't help but love it (even if it isn't anywhere near the first two). 
7419 This new cut is an improvement but it does little to actually change the overall feelings I have about this film. The changes work but they‚Äôre not vast improvements to bump this up a whole star or even half. Good movie but this still insanely messy. God does it look amazing in 4K though. 
7420  Ok yeah I get it now, this is the bad one. It's not terrible, but as the finale to the Godfather trilogy it's very disappointing. The film still looks pretty, the returning actors from the previous entries are great, the soundtrack is there, but the script itself, whoo boy.It's just an unnecessary coda, with no momentum and a shitty third act. Also yeah Sofia Coppola is not very good. P.S. I saw the MARIO PUZO'S THE GODFATHER, CODA: THE‚Ä¶

7434 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   In 1973, despite Cabaret sweeping for most of the night, it didn‚Äôt end up winning the Oscar for Best Picture by the end. It ended up losing to The Godfather, the first part of what would go on to become regarded as one of the greatest cinematic trilogies ever made. A massive, sprawling crime epic, unlike any ever previously made, it was the start of something truly unique and special. Two years later, The Godfather Part II did more than‚Ä¶

7437 It‚Äôs not a bad film whatsoever, it‚Äôs just a let down. I wanted so much more than this after watching the first two and it let me down. Performances were great, writing was great, overall it just wasn‚Äôt the same. 
7438 At this moment I feel no love for you at all 
7439  This watch was forTHE GODFATHER CODA: THE DEATH OF MICHAEL CORLEONEThis recut and restructuring of the 1990 original is a strong improvement for clarifying the story beats and helping to strengthen the daughter and cousin relationship BUT it doesn't change the pulpy histrionic energy on play here, which is what I disliked when I first saw it in 1990.I don't like the Papal narrative device and I disagree that decades of Michael's guilt and grief are dealt‚Ä¶  
7440  Hoo boy, this movie sucks... It has moments of an emotional core starting with Michael confessing his sins to the priest and breaking down into tears, and a few smaller moments in between. The plot feels too convoluted and drenched in boring politics and business talk.This movie follows a similar structure to the first two installments, with a party/event used to establish character dynamics, a climax involving Michael‚Äôs enemies being vanquished all at once, and a lot of visual‚Ä¶  
7441  Finally it‚Äôs the one that many people bash on. After watching it, it isn‚Äôt as bad as people claim it to be. Yes the story overall is inferior to the two entires before it but I think it wrapped the trilogy the best way possible.

7444  Now we at the End of The Godfather Trilogy With the Most Controversial Film in it. "The Godfather Part 3" This Film Genered Alot of Division And Mixed Reviews about it. Some people call it Good but not as it's Antecessors, some Call it a Terrible Movie, Others A Dissapointin and Other people say That it was really Good. In My Opinion? This Movie was Weak, Weak in not in the Sense of bad. Weak in the sense of could‚Ä¶

7446  I'll be honest, my new TV was delivered right in the middle of watching this. I paused and set the whole thing up to play the rest of the movie and was distracted by the added screen resolution. This mostly proved to be a problem because the plot got pretty convoluted toward the end and the Vatican characters were too interchangeable for me to follow along raptly. I really didn't notice any issues with Sofia's performance and mostly just appreciated‚Ä¶  
7447 The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone 
7448 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  I hate the way this movie paints the Catholic church as some sort of corrupt, greedy, money made organisation. My local church could barely string enough money together for a new marble statue of Mary. They had to up the heaven entry fee just to afford it.73/100  
7449 I think most of the hate generated toward this movie spawns from how good the previous 2 movies are. However, if you take this for what it is, there is quite a bit to enjoy. Of course there are several issues though and some I dislike some story choices. As a whole this is a perfectly average movie and if you are holding off watching it because of your love for the previous 2 then I still urge you to sit through all 170 minutes as there will most definitely be something to love. 
7450  Well, shoot. This movie is going to be hard to review. When I was in high school, I watched part one & two, loving both. I then started watching part three shortly after in school on my iPod, but never finished it. Every time after that I watched part one & two, didn‚Äôt even think about coming back to part three to finish. That is until this time around with rewatching part two. Just since I want to watch all of Francis‚Ä¶  
7451 ‚ÄúI Don‚Äôt Fear You, Michael. I Just Dread You.‚ÄùCoda is definitely the best way to watch Part 3, but even with its improvements, it can‚Äôt hide the mess this film is. So many weird decisions and moments, but the core of the film is the highlight. It sticks the ending hard, Al Pacino and other actors save this film, and if they just replace Vincent‚Äôs story of becoming the new leader with Michael‚Äôs son it would have made such a big improvement.If there‚Äôs one thing I can say about Coda is that it lives up to its title of The death of Michael Corleone. 
7452 imagine how much it would suck to play mary corleone‚Ä¶ all these hot dilfs and you have to act RELATED to them ‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è 
7453 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   If you watch intense crime movies saying it's so camp, these crazy rich italians need a lot of therapy, misogyny is kind of fruity bc why are these mafia bosses favouring men over women etc. they are actually 10x more fun to watch. Also, this isn't 'bad' as everyone says like the themes of catholicism, capitalism (specifically in regard to it catching up with Michael Corleone), sacrifice and family all create this sort of morbid look upon the reality these‚Ä¶

7455  so i finally rewatched the godfather trilogy, this movie is not a masterpiece or any close to the first two movies but its still a very good movie, al pacino is great here, vincent's character is probably my favorite thing in the movie.now the bad things:the plot was messy near the ending and i couldnt understand most of it, sofia coppola, please do not act in other movies, and also this is not such a good ending to‚Ä¶  
7456 Big deja vu feelings watching this, thought I hadn't seen it but maybe I had...liked it a lot more than expected given the reputation.Another case of watching the end credits and going that person was in it?

7457 theres some scenes here that got me thinking i was watching a rom-com movie.. its the fucking Godfather.. why‚Äôd you all tryna make us fall in love? 
7458 another coppola commentary!repeats a decent amount of stuff said in commentaries for 1 and especially 2, but who could blame him? it's pretty hard to talk for over 9 hours about essentially the same thing without repeating yourself.the best stuff is when he breaks down the way michael (and pacinos performance) destroys audience expectations of and desires for a godfather movie. while none in the trilogy will ever be among my favorite movies (or even my favorite coppola movies), that's the main reason i like this better than the second one. also cause the ending rules. one of my favorite final shots. 
7459 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael CorleoneI went into this with low expectations so I‚Äôm not as disappointed as I thought I‚Äôd be. Straight away it was obvious that this was a complete different film from the previous 2. The tone and atmosphere felt way off. Also, the dialogue was absolutely nowhere near the levels of the previous two.The new characters introduced were no good and I didn't really care about any of them. It was just‚Ä¶

7464  Nice try but this film is still a convoluted mess. The plot is so hard to follow and the characters do not make sense. ¬†I especially do not understand why Michael would trust Vincent at all or let him into his family. He explodes into a violent rage constantly and refuses to stop making out with his cousin, yet Michael keeps touting him as his successor. This guy coldly had his own brother killed for being a dunce but he‚Äôll‚Ä¶

7466  In the Coda cut, Francis Ford Coppola has an introductory segment talking to the camera, where he explains the "Coda" name reflects the film being a summing up of the themes and ideas of the previous two films.

If you're retracing those concepts, aren't you just retreading the same path, rather than carrying the audience to new places?The‚Ä¶

7468  Part 3 continues the tragedies of the Corleone family. 'Every time I think I am out of this mess, they pull me back in' Micheal says this after the attack. Part 3 is pretty much about this. As we witnessed in Part 2 Micheal is trying hard to legalise the family business. It follows the story of the family almost 6-8 years later and yet again starts with a party.Coppola and his fascination with introducing characters at a party.‚Ä¶

7470  What an embarrassment to two of the greatest films ever made.¬†This film is significantly different than the other two for several reasons- first of all, the first two are about power and its consequences but this one is about forgiveness. Diane Keaton and Al Pacino were great as always. But the best acting comes from the amazing Andy Garcia. He‚Äôs by far the best part of the film.¬†Then there‚Äôs Sofia Coppola. While people have said some atrociously harsh things about‚Ä¶  
7471 Fuck me Al Pacino ü•∫ 
7472  So it‚Äôs not as good as it‚Äôs predecessors, but I wouldn‚Äôt call this a bad film. Al Pacino is phenomenal. The A plot about Michael is great and works as a good end to the trilogy. Andy Garcia is great and does a good job with his role. I don‚Äôt hate Sofia Coppola, however she has some oof moments. The cousin-relationship subplot is awful and the only awful thing in this movie. On the whole, it‚Äôs not a bad movie,‚Ä¶  
7473 this one is not that bad. it‚Äôs less darker than the previous twos, still some scenes were good 
7474  I kind of liked this. I can understand the disappointment that this isn't a curtain call for the bigger cast of the first two movies, but it's a smaller story of Michael and his immediate family decades after those first movies. Sofia Coppola really isn't all that bad, she just has a very different energy than Al Pacino that is obvious in their one early scene together, then she spends the rest of the movie with characters that are more‚Ä¶

7477  Theatrical CutWithout a shadow of a doubt, this is the weakest film in the trilogy, though I hesitate to say that it's as awful as it's detractors make it out to be.It seems much more focused on being a character piece or an epilogue for Michael Corleone than it is on being another chapter in the saga. As much of the story is fixated around his deteriorating health, the guilt of killing his brother, and most importantly wanting‚Ä¶  
7478  Just rewatched this one as The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone.

I love that she‚Äôs bounced back so beautifully as a great writer and director. I would have hated her work as Mary Corleone to be her legacy. Secondly it lives in the enormous shadow of‚Ä¶

7481  "Just when I thought I was out... they pull me back in."I had this amazing idea that I started watching with the original version at the same time. But I didn't think about the sound, so I canceled this very good idea. üôÑ Maybe next time! I waited this excitedly and slightly nervously. I definitely wanted to see what the Master did with his film after 30 years. I have a hard time writing about it because this film‚Ä¶  
7482 Andy garcia acts like Hayden Christiansen¬†in this and its very distractingThis movie occupies such a weird space in cinema. The previous two are near flawless masterpieces and then corporate greed and FFC being broke lead to this. But how can it be such a step down? What lead to this its insane to even think about 
7483  Watched the Coda: Yeah it‚Äôs more streamlined, but Godfather 3 was nether a great, and frankly not good movie. The acting and plot just can‚Äôt be magically made good because of editing. While the acting for several cast members had problems, It really all comes back to the plot, both in concept and execution. No idea was the right one. The fall of Michael isn‚Äôt the worst idea ever, and I understand that this film is over hated, but not‚Ä¶  
7484  LA TR√ÅGICA MUERTE DE MICHAEL CORLEONEAntes de empezar, debo dejar en claro que la versi√≥n analizada es la CODA. Esto es necesario porque la opini√≥n de cada qui√©n depende de cu√°l versi√≥n de la pel√≠cula vean y c√≥mo la interpreten. Queda a su discreci√≥n. En caso que lo est√©n preguntando, la versi√≥n original tiene una calificaci√≥n de 3.5.Era obvio que cualquier cosa que viniera despu√©s de 2 obras maestras tan s√≥lidas y tan aclamadas no iba a cumplir‚Ä¶  
7485 Doesn‚Äôt quite have the high highs of the first two, and Sofia is unfortunately as bad as I‚Äôd remembered, but it‚Äôs a solid and beautifully lensed movie with a handful of great scenes, and getting the extra quality time with Michael and Kay is absolutely worth the price of admission. 
7486 Good ending but when you make two flawless movies and the third has some clear flaws (I‚Äôm looking at you incest side plot) it‚Äôs gonna get hate. I do think in the future I‚Äôd just watch Part I and Part II as a duology.

7489 the shortest AND the longest movie of the trilogy simultaneously. that‚Äôs v impressive 
7490 Andy Garc√≠a and Sofia Coppola are just so adorable... 
7491 Never had I actually seen the epic conclusion to this trilogy before until now. I wasn‚Äôt really looking forward to watching it but I felt like I had to see it at least once. I see myself rewatching the first two multiple times but will probably never watch this again. It‚Äôs so damn boring and pointless. Not very interesting at all and I just don‚Äôt care. After watching all 3 of them back to back, this looks like complete dogshit in comparison. Not the worst movie ever made though. Despite being the shortest it feels the longest in the trilogy 
7492 Sofia Coppola looks like she doesn't want to be in there. 
7493  Yeah, this wasn't it.This was way less interesting and tense as its predecessors. Living up to either of them is a hard task, of course, but this film fell short even on a basic level, in terms of pacing, story, and even dialogue at times.The acting was either great (Pacino, Keaton) or okay (Coppola was bad, but I don't think all the criticism is warranted). I liked Andy Garcia on this as well. The story though is just‚Ä¶  
7494  It‚Äôs clearly not up to par with the other two films... but, oddly, it‚Äôs Al Pacino‚Äôs best performance as Michael Corleone? ¬†In the other two movies he is so reptilian and soulless; here he is aging and tired, facing a lifetime of sins, desperate to get out of his life of crime. ¬†From that standpoint, the majority of the Michael scenes are terrific.On the other hand, Sofia Coppola is... miscast here at best. Her acting is not great. The‚Ä¶

7497  The Godfather: Part III (1990) or Mario Puzo‚Äôs The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone (2020) is definitely the worst part in the series but still not bad at times. I watched the original cut and the new cut released in 2020 and I have to say that even though they weren‚Äôt too different from each other, they felt so different. Where The Godfather: Part III fails is where The Godfather, Coda shines. The opening to the original cut‚Ä¶  
7498  Can't tell if it was either the recut or that maybe it's just that I haven't seen this film in a long time but I found Part III to be quite a decent experience. It still pales in comparison to the first two masterpieces and I still could've done without Sofia Coppola (much better as a director), but this Coda version does a good job fleshing out Michael Corleone and the inner-workings of his mafia family and I enjoyed the‚Ä¶

7500 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   I got duped into watching the new version that just came out after hearing it was a completely different experience. It wasn't. There were tiny tweaks throughout but nothing that fixed what didn't work the first time. The scenes in Sicily always had charm and feel right, but overall it's a soapy hodgepodge and an obvious cash grab. Apparently Pacino never felt his character would ever try to redeem himself but took the money anyway. The result is a hammy‚Ä¶   
7501 (This is a review for The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone, not the original version)This movie surprised me a bit. It was pretty alright. Compared to the first two, it's not very good, and it's cheesy with some pretty bad acting, but it still keeps the same feel of the godfather films, and is a relatively satisfying end to the trilogy. 
7502  "I swear on the lives of my children: Give me a chance to redeem myself, and I will sin no more."(CODA cut)Still functionally the same movie it always was with all the same problems (and no I'm not talking about Sofia here lol, she isn't good but if the rest-of-movie were as good as the first two no one would care, leave her be), the story doesn't quite feel complete without Robert Duvall and this doesn't really hit‚Ä¶  
7503  All I've heard my whole life is that Sofia Coppola ruined this franchise. I wanted to see for myself before watching the new Godfather Coda. To me, it seems evident that the script and pacing betrays the actors, particularly Coppola and Andy Garcia. Mary and Vincent's arcs are rushed and incomplete, diluting the emotional impact of the ending. I appreciate Francis Ford Coppola's honest assessment: Sofia took the bullet for him.But flashes of the old magic still peak through.‚Ä¶  
7504 Imagine how good this would have been if Winona played Mary Corleone! 
7505  Watched the new edit. I've always dug Godfather 3. It doesn't come close to the greatness of the first 2, but it's a solid movie on it's own. I'm giving the new edit the same score, but I do think this is a big improvement over the theatrical version. It's a little shorter. The story flows better with some of the rearranged scenes, especially the scene that now opens the movie. It makes way more sense to jump right to‚Ä¶  
7506 just when i thought i was out, they pull me back in! (except for the part where sofia coppola and andy garcia have that weird passionless kiss to miracle man by elvis costello, i‚Äôm out on that) 
7507  Opened 30 years ago today, which also marks 30 years of everyone bitching about Sofia Coppola's performance. She's bad, but it's not her fault. She never should've been there in the first place. To state the obvious, this isn't anywhere near the level of its two predecessors, it suffers from the absence of Robert Duvall, and after seeing it multiple times over the last few decades, I still don't give the slightest shit about goddamn Immobiliare. But it's nice to‚Ä¶  
7508 coppola edited everything except his daughter‚Äôs bad acting 
7509  4.0/5.0 = AmazingI don't remember how old I was the last time I saw Coppola's final entry into his mobster saga. I remember seeing all three films back to back as a kid, and that my father actually really hyped me up for the climactic opera steps scene of the third film, but as the years went by and I drank the "THE GODFATHER: PART III sucks" kool-aid, I didn‚Äôt return to it, albeit never having disliked the experience‚Ä¶  
7510 Mario Puzo‚Äôs The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael CorleoneThere are a few scenes swapped around and a few little cuts here and there but I couldn't really tell the difference from the original Godfather Part III, which I always liked a lot. The title makes it clearer that this was an epilogue rather than the third part of a trilogy, but Coppola also, ironically, puts back the original title 'The Death of Michael Corleone' while taking out the scene of his actual death. 
7511  Just when I thought I was out...they PULL me back in.O final da trilogia de Francis Ford Coppola pode n√£o ser uma unanimidade, mas pelo menos para mim √© um final bem digno para trilogia. The Godfather Part III √© de fato inferior aos antecessores. √â louv√°vel que mesmo ap√≥s tanto tempo, Coppola conseguiu trazer grande parte do elenco e equipe de volta. Ent√£o temos o retorno de grande parte do elenco como Al Pacino e Diane Keaton, al√©m‚Ä¶  
7512 I'm still not on board with the minor subplots, but I can't deny that Coda¬†is the superior, more focused version - and the true epilogue this story has needed for years. So glad Coppola was able to get this out.Makes a very nice companion piece to last year's The Irishman. 
7513  The Godfather CodaThis was always a good movie to be quite frank and really this doesn't change a ton accept make it flow so much better which is enough of a plus to warrant its existence. The complaints on this, while totally valid, I do think overlook the fact that Coppola touches on some really chilling personal crisis that one reaches towards the end of their lives and the more overt tackling of economics and religion is riveting. Not‚Ä¶  
7514 I never hated the original, but this makes a few editorial clarifications and improvements ‚Äî I only wish Coppola had more ruthless in the cutting room. This could‚Äôve been even shorter. And for the record, criticism of Sofia‚Äôs performance is largely overstated. Like the original version, there are moments of brilliance, moments of mediocrity, and an overall feeling that it was rushed out the door. But still, a slight improvement. 
7515 Not bad for a fitting conclusion of the GODFATHER saga, fifteen years after the sequel was made. In THE GODFATHER III, Don Corleone plans an agreement with several crime organizations and the Corleone clan became a suspect of a setup. The Vatican was entangled in one of the most interesting subplots and the appearance of Sofia Coppola as Corleone's daughter, was maligned by most critics. Anticipating for the new reeedit one THE GODFATHER CODA. 
7516 Review for The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone.A shorter movie, better movie, still weird incest bullshit but it's a huge improvement on Godfather 3.

7518 The ‚ÄòCoda‚Äô cut.¬†This was an improvement over the original cut, focusing on the finance dealings with the Vatican and Michael‚Äôs attempts to purchase legitimacy and redemption. Previously these things kinda got lost in the mire. It‚Äôs not up there with the first two but it‚Äôs repositioning means it sits better alongside them.

7528  Godfather, Coda: Death of Michael Corleone (Anniversary Cut).The fact Francis Ford Coppola did not want to make these films finally rears its head in this film no matter what way he cuts it. A studio means to an end, by that I mean he was able to make his personal films because of the success of the previous films in the saga.

It obviously mirrors the opening of the previous two films, and The Godfather most especially. This is a business‚Ä¶  
7530  This new edit of The Godfather 3 doesn't seek to radically change the film but merely re-structure and tinker with key elements to bring it new life as the great film it originally had the potential to be.The new opening gives the film a  much  needed sense of forward momentum and clarifies the previously much too complicated nature of the plot. As a result pacing is greatly improved and the whole movie is a lot more involving. The film's‚Ä¶

7536  I actually enjoyed this entry quite a bit more than I thought it would. I knew it always got a bad rap for not being as good as the first two, but let‚Äôs be honest: how can you make a third¬†film be as good as two of the greatest films ever made?PROS:- Andy Garcia, Al Pacino, and Diane Keaton- Keeps tension throughout the entire film (even when it‚Äôs slow: you worry that something is about to happen‚Ä¶  
7537 So you‚Äôre telling me that Andy Garcia (Vincent) received an Oscar nomination for his role in this?! (SCREAMS LIKE AL PACINO) 
7538 Non c'√® cosa pi√π divina... 
7539  This is what I expected out of ‚ÄúThe Irishman‚Äù and this also had more lines given to the female characters in the film vs afore mentioned film. (No hate towards ‚ÄúThe Irishman‚Äù.)-‚ÄúWhat is the point of confessing if I do not repent?‚Äù‚ÄúYour sins are terrible, and it is just that you suffer. Your life could be redeemed, but I know you do not believe that. You will not change. [crosses to Michael] In nomine Patris et Filii‚Ä¶  
7540 Incest much? 
7541 A sound, although needless, conclusion to Michael Corleone‚Äôs story. Not at all up to the same standards as the first two, but it‚Äôs okay; the opera act was fantastically directed!Sofia Coppola nearly ruined this completely for me; what a horrible actress (alongside a few other iffy performances). Nepotism, huh? 
7542 A totally enjoyable film whose few noticeable shortcomings are to do with a slightly tentative approach at redoing the old style and good characters who died in earlier parts (or in Tom Hagen's case, between 2 and 3) not being available, and nothing to do with Sofia Coppola who is actually good in this.The ending, with Michael dying old and alone on a barren strip of land, mirroring his own father dying in an orange grove surrounded by family, might seem hasty and awkward. But it also feels true. He never tended the fruit and it never grew. 
7543  For years I've been saying that people overreacted to The Godfather Part III. I said it wasn't as good as the first two but still well made and an essential part of the story.Holy shit, was I wrong.The only aspect of this story that I still like is that Michael is trying to redeem himself for his actions, both through family and business. I like that he still doesn't get a happy ending. I also appreciate the commentary‚Ä¶  
7544 MY LUCKY COAT 
7545 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  There is a lot of stuff that really works in The Godfather Part 3. But as unfairly maligned as I believe it to be, it does have a few problems. I still can‚Äôt make sense of everything with the Catholic Church in the 3rd act. It‚Äôs so confusing that I can‚Äôt track it for the life of me.  
7546 The Coppolas sure kept it in the family

7548  √â insano imaginar que n√≥s vivemos em um mundo onde esse filme recebeu um 3.4/5 na avalia√ß√£o geral do letterboxd. Eu sempre me questionei o porque da nota baixa (comparado aos antecessores) e agora, depois de ter visto o filme, eu mantenho o meu questionamento.Ok... o filme n√£o √© t√£o gigante quanto os dois primeiros, de fato, mas t√° longe de ser ruim. Acompanhamos dois filmes (bem longos) que promoveram uma constru√ß√£o cir√∫rgica do imp√©rio dos Corleone, como eles‚Ä¶

The carried over praises revolve around Al Pacino‚Äôs performance, the direction, editing, cinematography, dialogue, musical score, themes and the pure suspense and poignance of the whole third act that gets you off the edge of your fu**ing seat. On rewatch, the movie fails to keep me invested a fair bit of the time. One of the reasons is:‚Ä¶

7554  I don‚Äôt have as much to say about this film as I did with the other two, simply because there isn‚Äôt that much to talk about, so I‚Äôll keep this relatively brief. This film is just kinda disappointing. It‚Äôs not terrible per se, but it‚Äôs incredibly unnecessary and misses most everything I love about the first two. I don‚Äôt remember liking it when I first saw it years ago, but I went into this rewatch with somewhat of an open‚Ä¶  
7555 Despite attempts to imbue the preceding films with more dramatic heft, the third act is too convoluted to effectively close out the trilogy. - ‚ñ∫

7559 I prefer Sofia Coppola‚Äôs performance in the first Godfather.... when she did not actually have any lines because she was a baby. 
7560 this movie went from sicily to alabama pretty quickly 
7561 my only problem w the godfather trilogy is that all of the white men (except tom, michael, fredo, sonny, vito and vincent) look the same so 60% of the time i have no idea who‚Äôs who üò≠üò≠ 
7562 The lesser of the GODFATHER films, but it's still a decent entry into the trilogy, at least when it's focused on Michael, his sins and how that's weighed on him all these years. Hear our full review on #376. 
7563 I'm the days into "movies I May regret". Elle and I decided to binge the entire godfather trilogy in a single sitting. I never saw three and wish that were still the case.¬†It felt like the angsty teen cousin. Which I guess it's the point? Elle found an article online which stated that this is a MUST WATCH for fans of the series because it tires up all the loose ends. No. Fuck whoever said that inaccurate statement. 
7564 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   the guy in the advert who said this was his favorite godfather film is a fucking idiot. as someone who watched all the godfather films in quick succession, i can see why this is considered the weakest. there are moments in this film which briefly reach the quality of the previous two films but, unlike the first two, there are also very brief moments which are god fucking awful. that helicopter scene was the absolute worst!! im shocked that it‚Ä¶

7566 5.0/10Man you know what The Godfather series was really missing?An incest subplot...A completely unnecessary sequel that is both incredibly boring and hard to follow. Apparently Coppola only made this movie for money and man does it show. 
7567 I just want Francis Ford Coppola to explain to me why those cousins wanted to fuck each other so badly, and why it was so important to the story. I'm curious, but mostly concerned.¬†This is why no one wants to fund his movies now. 
7568 crazy how everyone was wrong and convinced me to not see this for years. 
7569  Extremely disappointing film considering the two masterpieces that came before it. It‚Äôs very clear this didn‚Äôt need to be made after the perfect conclusion in Part II.This isn‚Äôt a terrible movie though. There‚Äôs some pretty good and promising stuff within here. Al Pacino is great as always; the confession scene is very touching and well done; Antony singing to his father for the first time is extremely emotional, as are the scenes between Michael and Kay.Unfortunately there are‚Ä¶  
7570 Major disappointment. Felt like a parody of the first two movies. Garcia and pacino save it from being a total embarrassment. 
7571  ‚ÄúJust when I thought I was out...they pull me back in.‚ÄùA film that repeatedly pulled me in then took me out. The Godfather: Part III, while not necessarily a bad film, is incredibly disappointing compared to the previous two. It‚Äôs a total mixed bag, there were plenty of scenes that had me engulfed, but there was an almost equal amount of scenes that did the complete opposite.Al Pacino gives it his all here, although the way his character‚Ä¶  
7572 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   The Godfather: Part III is widely considered one of the most disappointing movies of all time. Some go as far to say, that it is a bad movie. And while I don't share that opinion, I also can't make that many excuses for it.Part III unfortunately doesn't capture any of the epic feel that the first two had. It does have it's bright spots, namely Al Pacino and Diane Keaton. Every scene they share is good, some even great.‚Ä¶   
7573 What I hate most about this trash 90`s B-Tier crime drama disguised as a Godfather movie, is that it made my Dad be utterly and sorrowfully disappointed upon the realization that a Coppola film; a Godfather film no less, could be this fucking awful. 
7574 It wasn‚Äôt even good and then they killed my favourite character at the end!! üò≠üò≠ worst movie ever 
7575 While I think its still a competently made film, The Godfather Part III should be further proof that just because you have the same director and crew on board, it doesn't mean they can give you a follow up that you are going to be satisfied with. 
7576  √â oficial, quem assiste a trilogia ‚ÄúPoderoso Chef√£o‚Äù se torna f√£ dela e do cinema na mesma hora. Finalmente, terminei de assistir a trilogia, com o terceiro filme da franquia, que fecha at√© dignamente a saga da Fam√≠lia Corleone. 16 anos depois, Francis Ford Copolla volta a dirigir √† sua trilogia, contra sua vontade inicialmente, pois achava que a hist√≥ria acabaria no segundo filme e que fizera bastante sucesso, por isso ele voltou. Pois, os dois primeiros s√£o duas obras‚Ä¶  
7577 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   It's baffling to me that Coppola made this. The guy who approached the first 2 films with extreme caution and integrity would make a film that feels like a studio product (which it is) helmed by a new director trying to imitate what the first two films felt like.It's not a horrible film at all, in fact, it has its moments, great moments too! (Most of them being courtesy of Al Pacino)"Joey, if there is some guy running‚Ä¶   
7578  It could have been a lot better if someone else had played Mary. Look, Sofia Coppola is a terrific director, but an actress she is not. Now if the role was less important it would have mattered less, but the role was pivotal - the character basically the heart of the movie besides Michael. And boy oh boy. Her line delivery.... eek. I was thinking to myself during it that she sounded like one of the Naboo handmaidens in Phantom‚Ä¶  
7579 ‚ÄúI would burn in hell to keep you safe.‚Äù 
7580 ‚ÄúJust when I thought I was out, they pull me back in.‚ÄùNot as good as the first two but I still enjoyed how it all wraps up in the end. 
7581  Not as good or complex as the first two movies, as there are some sloppy moments in the beginning, and Sofia Coppola's acting is distractingly wooden, but The Godfather: Part III makes for a great closure to the trilogy and Michael's arc. I think Francis Ford Coppola does a great job delving into the guilt and regret of the main character, and the final scene is the icing on the cake for a journey such as this one. Say what‚Ä¶

7584  C'est un film tr√®s diff√©rent des deux premi√®res parties. Comme la qu√™te du protagoniste principal se centre sur un d√©sir de r√©demption et sur une r√©flexion sur le pass√©, c'est un film un peu plus lumineux malgr√© sa structure tragique. La structure du sc√©nario n'est pas aussi habile que les deux sc√©narios pr√©c√©dents. Sa jongle avec des trames un peu moins engageante.

7585  This is my review for the newly released cut of the film, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone.It's been so long since I saw the original theatrical cut that I can't confidently determine whether this cut is an improvement or not. If I had to, I would say this time around, watching it, the film's pacing feels more organic, the characters feel more defined in their personalities and motivations. Still, it doesn't magically remedy what is ultimately a very‚Ä¶  
7586 Necesitaba m√°s escenas como la confesi√≥n y el final, y √©sta historia de redenci√≥n se siente demasiado alargada para ocupar 2 h 40 mins. Pero la ambientaci√≥n de la pel√≠cula me ha parecido interesante, tanto por el hecho de que se siente un ep√≠logo muy cerrado como por el tema de que ya no es una pel√≠cula de mafia, aparte que el personaje de Michael Corleone recibe ese desarrollo extra que, como dije, da lugar al estupendo, tr√°gico final. 
7587 do yourself the favor of watching the series and stopping after II, cause this le not good.id also like to note that before watching this movie, i thought coppola was too smart to cast his daughter in a movie even if she‚Äôs a bad actress. meaning i gave sofia the benefit of the doubt although i had heard bad things about her performance. now, after watching the film i think sofia coppola may have given one of the worst performances i have ever seen in movie. also why was it ok that her character was tryna fuck her cousin 
7588  ‚ÄúJust when I thought I was out, they pull me back in‚ÄùIm sure you‚Äôre all wondering if this really is as bad as people say. Conclusively, I can definitely say it is the weakest of the trilogy, but I cannot say that this is as bad as it‚Äôs been hailed.¬†To kick this off, the best part of this movie is Pacino. The themes of guilt and regret, when explored are very powerful, as he‚Äôs a man, who can‚Ä¶  
7589  It looks like a Godfather film, but it doesn't feel like one. I'd love to offer a passionate defense for this, but I don't really have any strong feelings, either positive or negative. Coppola made this because he had to for financial reasons, and it really feels like he and Puzo just said, "Here you go; here's some more Corleone stuff." On its own merits, it's fine, and I'm trying not to judge it based on two all-time great films.‚Ä¶

7591 It's almost common knowledge that this film gets a boatload of flack, but I actually found "The Godfather Part III" to be quite an engaging and gratifying conclusion to the truly epic trilogy. While the film does have a few flagrant problems here and there, I find its merits to outweigh them deftly. 
7592 This is why I‚Äôm terrified they‚Äôll make a third Mamma Mia 
7593  or that time I was hoodwinked and bamboozled by the Film Forum because I was promised a 35mm screening of Part III but actually ended up with Francis Ford Coppola's brand-new, never-before-seen re-cut, now titled what he had always wanted to call it: The Godfather - Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone !!!!Hence I shall now divide this review into three sections in honor of III: I.

7596 EMBARRASING 
7597  OofThe Godfather: Part III is a failure. I was hoping it would be good, but my hope was misplaced.I only have some general thoughts, nothing too in-depth. Part III lacks care and epicness, which Parts I and II thrived on, and traded it for cheesiness. (Like Vincent biting Zasa's ear, the helicopter scene, the ending, and Sofia Coppola's acting.) Because of its cheesiness, Part III lacks style. The first two Parts had sophistication to them, but Part III‚Ä¶

7599 when this starts with a 10 minute long, hastily cut together recap of two whole movies, you know you‚Äôre in for a rough ride 
7600  More than fifteen years later came out the final part in the trilogy, anticipation was high and the dissapointment was as heavy as Michael Corleone‚Äôs old man-balls. But looking at the classic trilogy now, part III is a lot better than people think. I would even go so far as saying it is superior to the second movie. This shit is not about real estate at all! The reach of the mob goes as high as the Vatican, corrupting the‚Ä¶  
7601 Needlessly complicated, mediocre acting and over-the-top. Francis Ford Coppola began this trilogy with ground breaking cinema to a sadly unsatisfying conclusion. 
7602 Sofia Coppola is a dream 
7603  Despite a logical extension into international control mechanisms this belated coda lacks gravitas. It‚Äôs too slightingly brisk in handling with its weak characterisation (a mishandled Garcia, a superfluous Fonda and as for poor Ms. Coppola...)Plot lines either peter out (Fonda‚Äôs journalism) or simply doesn‚Äôt develope what could have been interesting (the dramatic goldmine of Vatican corruption) until it‚Äôs nearly too late. Connie‚Äôs intriguing emergence as a latent Lady MacBeth isn‚Äôt worked enough and Kay is there for the sake‚Ä¶  
7604 An extension of the Godfather film saga which was...unnecessary.I like the addition of Andy Garcia as Vincent Corleone.. Sofia Coppola as Mary? Wow. Abysmal acting. She won a Razzie for Worst Actress! But she proved to be a solid director.. acting‚Äôs not her forte.The story is okay? It has suspense and the riveting atmosphere but largely inferior to the two great predecessors.It‚Äôs an okay film but the WORST obviously of the three in the franchise. 
7605 Apparently Coppola originally wanted to title this The Death of Michael Corleone. This got me thinking; instead of a tired, wannabe epic that always feels like it's trying too hard to recapture old magic, imagine if this had been a ninety-minute chamber piece a la Bergman. Imagine something so intensely intimate and focused; Michael in his late years filled with a lifetime of regret. Something quiet.This could've been beautiful. 
7606  Utterly disappointing compared to the magnitude of its predecessors‚Äô achievements, but nonetheless occasionally compelling and visually transfixing in its own right. Its deep-seated imperfections perhaps literalize the melancholic feeling of a world order on the precipice of change that underscored its ethereally perfect predecessors; here is a film with the visual magnificence and stupefying beauty of a bona fide Classic, a ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt make them¬†like this anymore‚Äù work of epic proportions, beautifully scored and lyrically shot, but with the narrative‚Ä¶  
7607  What really works here is all of the stuff with Michael and Kay. My favorite sequence of this is easily the scene where he steals the car and takes her on a tour around Sicily. Their relationship is as solid as ever and I really love how this film advances it. I especially love the moment at the climax when Kay looks up from her crying and sees Michael screaming and she has a look on his face that almost‚Ä¶  
7608 i mean yeah if sofia coppola was MY first cousin id definitely try to sleep with her too 
7609 tried for days but could not finish it bc of pacino‚Äôs hair and sofia‚Äôs acting (the nepotism is Wild). at least i saw the ‚Äòthey pull me back in‚Äô scene but it was just as good in the sopranos 
7610 I don't have nearly the problems that so many do with this film. I think it's a really strong ending to the trilogy. Unfortunately, it does get bogged down with some script and casting issues, but Pacino and Keaton are in fine form. 
7611  Two things that I think get underrated in Godfather III:1) The opening scene, I love how in the first film you have this effortless roots oriented family celebration, which is replaced by the uber WASPy party in Part 2 in an effort to shed ethnicity and join the upper classes. The party in 3 is clearly an attempt to reclaim the warm ethnic roots. Everything is plastic, forced and horrible, it's too late to reclaim the past, the Corleone's‚Ä¶

7613  #37 in my collection rewatch. Again, not really a rewatch, first time watching. Sofia Coppola is an absolutely horrible actress. Seriously. Oh my gosh, it's some of the worst acting I've seen in a film with such prestige as this one. Also, Al Pacino seems to have worsened significantly in the twenty-six years between the last film and this one. The all-star cast both helps along the film and worsens it in ways. The film loses a lot by being‚Ä¶  
7614 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   This film surprised me. I wasn't expecting the same level of class to live on in this franchise fifteen years later, but it did. Set in 1979, and with a solid Andy Garcia taking the youthful lead position, the film followed the structure of the first film but this time did something bold in exposing corruption in the Vatican. What also surprised me was the attention to Michael Corleone‚Äôs gradual disintegration. I never thought I would shed a tear for‚Ä¶   
7615  It's true that we judge this movie too quickly by what it isn't--which is to say the first two parts. But it still defines itself by what it isn't--which is to say an earlier draft where being "pulled back in" had more to do with old ghosts than Catholic financial conspiracies. If a Godfather movie cannot have Tom Hagen, then his son must play a role that reminds Michael of his own cruelty, not just an empty Church icon that‚Ä¶  
7616  Yes, this film has it's faults. I do think it is the weakest of the 3 Godfather films. The story is uneven at points, and Sofia Coppola gives the weakest performance of the whole franchise. But mixed in with the chaff, there‚Äôs a lot of fantastic stuff. On a superficial level, the helicopter attack in Atlantic City is one of the series‚Äô bloodiest and most viscerally effective sequences; and in true Godfather tradition, the final montage of assassinations is beautifully‚Ä¶  
7617  Firstly let me get a rant out of the way, what is the big deal about Sofia Coppola's performance? She is barely even in it - her character adds nothing to plot outside of her final scene and she has very little dialogue. It is like complaining about that character in your favourite tv show that appears every 3 or 4 eps. Would you complain about Starburns' acting in Community? Hmm.Anyway, the argument doesn't really matter because I don't‚Ä¶  
7618  Considering the first two Godfather films are legendary masterworks in cinema, the third film in the Corleone crime saga is a bit of a disappointment. The film lacks the sheer power and intensity of the first two films. The film is almost a dud, and despite it's legendary title, The Godfather Part III is an average film in the thrilling Corleone crime sage. Al Pacino manages to keep this film afloat, but Sofia Coppola takes it down a notch. This‚Ä¶  
7619 Finally through my rewatch of the series. This was my second watch of this one, even though I've seen the first two more, so it was very fun revisiting this with all it's criticisms. Sofia Coppola is bad in this, she just has the no emotion with all of her lines. The story is drawn out for it's runtime and it feels like they just tried getting it close to three hours to match the others. also, nice incest sub-plot 
7620 Contains all the same elements as the first two (crime, religion, power, family), but fails to assemble them to create the same dramatic or emotional impact. Even in the Coda edit, the storytelling is too choppy and unfocused to make us care. It really is the Fredo of the trilogy. 
7621 AND FINALLY, oh Micheal losing his first wife, and the fact that Kay also had an abortion but I know they love each other and lost his beloved daughter (Mary), I don't think abt Vincent bcs he has the ambition to become the next Godfather even though I know he is very sad about losing Mary, but come on, Micheal's life is very tragic ... rest in peace DON VITO and DON MICHAEL you deserve love, NO MORE WORDS, THE BEST TRILOGY, THE GODFATHER ü§ùüèΩ 
7622 Watched the recut rerelease. The start of this film is so shockingly bad that I had to check if the same DP worked on this one. He did. Dunno where the awful coverage choices came from. As the movie continues either you start to accept how mediocre it is or it gets better. I can't decide. 
7623  Me gust√≥ la pel√≠cula, pero no le doy las 5 estrellas porque...¬øPor qu√© decidieron darle un final tan miserable a Michael Corleone? Despu√©s de ver las dos primeras partes de la trilog√≠a, en las cuales se demuestra cu√°l era la personalidad del protagonista, me pareci√≥ sumamente absurdo que hayan decidido darle ese final.¬øA quien se le ocurri√≥ que era una buena idea crear un avistamiento de romance entre primos? Tanta raz√≥n ten√≠a Mike Corleone en opornerse rotundamente a‚Ä¶  
7624  Blunt assessment: the original 1990 theatrical cut of The Godfather: Part III is abysmal. Meandering storytelling and distracting performances¬†(Sofia Coppola, George Hamilton, Joe Mantegna, Andy Garcia) make it extremely hard to defend Paramount‚Äôs approved Final Cut of¬†‚ÄòPart III.‚Äô People do (Hi, Garrett!) But those people really shouldn‚Äôt (Sorry, Garrett!)So I went into The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone ‚Äî Coppola‚Äôs 2020 Re-Edit ‚Äî with pretty low expectations. And I left‚Ä¶somewhat impressed.¬†Joey Zasa is still a deeply‚Ä¶  
7625 Give Me A Chance To Redeem Myself And I Will Sin No More 
7626 love Sofia Coppola as a director but as an actor mehhh 
7627 Once you get over Al Pacino's cocaine era hairstyle this movie is not as bad as people say it is.The third act is great and Andy Garcia's performance is a show stealer. What spoils this movie for me is all the behind-the-scenes antics... No Robert Duvall, an uninterested director & writer... It's a shame it doesn't have as much heart put into it compared to the first two. 
7628  Quite possibly the most overhated sequel I have ever seen. It is nearly impossible to make a film that lives up to its huge expectations after making two of the best movies ever made, anything less than that is failure. Sofia Coppola should not get all the blame for the critical bomb that this was. She is not a good actress, but you have to cut her some slack, this was her first real role and there was no actress‚Ä¶  
7629 what. 
7630  In giving a conclusion to two of the most powerful crime and family stories to come out of the seventies, (As well as 2 of my fav movies of all time) Francis Ford Coppola took a risk that many feel didn't pay off and I‚Äôve heard many people not really enjoying it. And I really wish I hadn‚Äôt heard of these criticisms before going into this but it didn‚Äôt really affect my judgement too much. I‚Äôve heard people speaking about‚Ä¶  
7631 Should‚Äôve never been made only got a star because it‚Äôs part of one of the best franchises ever made but no one‚Äôs cousin is that hot. Only good thing that came out of this was Sofia watched her godawful performance and decided to follow in her dads footsteps. 
7632 borinGGGG until legit the last 10 mins it had cool gothic religious imagery tho 
7633 I had an expectation for the end but got disappointed. I think this third installment was needed because I had a question regarding how Michael feels about being exactly the person he didn't want to be. This installment answered that. 
7634 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Watched the Coda edit- this was a very good movie. Came together really well, with a great ending, better than what I just read the other ending was. So, since it was shockingly not bad based on what I'd been trained to expect by ~society~ My main gripe of the movie was plot based. I do not understand how, when ceding his Godfatherdom, Michael just lets his bloodthirsty twenty something nephew he just met be the new Don Corleone?? His‚Ä¶   
7635 It‚Äôs nowhere near the first 2 films but I still think this is undeniably a good film. They probably could have cut 20-30 minutes off and the cousin love was a bad gamble and they could have easily removed that relationship as it was unnecessary. I do think this end to the saga is extremely important in order to tell the whole story. The last 10 minutes are very powerful. Great trilogy. 
7636 The Godfather wouldn't be what it is without this film's last 40 minutes.What the fuck is wrong with y'all this was fucking amazing.Yes the screenplay had serious issues, yes the first act was the weakest of the 3 films, yes Sofia Coppola and Andy Garcia gave bad performances; BUT DAMN THOSE LAST 40 MINUTES WERE SO FUCKING BEAUTIFUL.Tightly wrapped up the whole Trilogy and did it very fittingly so. It has the best aspects of the previous two films tied together. 
7637  The Godfather Part III is a 1990 American epic crime film produced and directed by Francis Ford Coppola from the screenplay co-written with Mario Puzo. The film stars Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Andy Garc√≠a, Eli Wallach, Joe Mantegna, Bridget Fonda, George Hamilton, and Sofia Coppola. It is the third and final installment in The Godfather trilogy. A sequel to The Godfather (1972) and The Godfather Part II (1974), it concludes the fictional story of Michael Corleone, the patriarch‚Ä¶  
7638  Just when I thought I was out‚Ä¶ they pull me backThe subtleties and the broad strokes that created the meditative reflection offered in the first two is gone - this is now a post-80‚Äôs world after all. The theme is belaboured and spelled out, characters say ‚ÄúI feel, I think‚Äù rather than show us with actions and expressions and scenes play out like a standard action flick (the helicopter hit, the scene with the quote above, parade scene). Pacino‚Ä¶  
7639  If The Godfather¬†is Messi, and The Godfather: Part II¬†is Ronaldo, then that would make The Godfather: Part III¬†Luis Suarez, and let me explain. Just as the peaks of Suarez‚Äôs career reach heights actually not far from Messi and Ronaldo, so too do the peaks of Part III. Pacino, once again, is absolutely incredible. I liked Andy Garcia as Vincent and the idea of Sonny‚Äôs son becoming the new Don Corleone. The final sequences during the opera, while somewhat unoriginal from‚Ä¶  
7640  I finally got around to watching The Godfather Part 3 and In no means is this a bad movie as some would like to say but its defintley not great, there alot of problems with this film such as some wierd acting and line delivery from Sophia Coppala along with a incest plot with here cousin?????? also the final act is dreadfully too long in my opinion and overall the movie just seems to forgets what made the first 2‚Ä¶  
7641  CODA: The death of Michael Corleone cutMight be sacrilege but I actually might prefer this to part 2 and don't really have any problems with it (yeah Sofia Coppola's performance is a little awkward occasionally but I don't think it really breaks anything within the film and she sells enough of it to give what ultimately happens some emotional weight, though as a fan I'm glad she chose to pursue a directing career instead). I found it to be‚Ä¶  
7642 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   I found this watch to be quite disappointing. If it weren't for its association with "The Godfather," I doubt I would have bothered watching it. The portrayal of Michael and Al Pacino's performance fell short, lacking the authenticity I expected. It felt like a watered-down version of their characters with little effort invested. Cousin Vincent's presence on screen was a nightmare, and every scene with him was unbearable. The pasta scene, in particular, was a low point. Mary's performance was‚Ä¶   
7643 Overhated fr 
7644  Honestamente, pude ver lo que la Parte III estaba tratando de lograr. El propio Coppola ha admitido que los dos primeros Padrinos son la verdadera historia y la Parte III es solo un ep√≠logo. Aqu√≠, tenemos el comienzo de la pel√≠cula como comenz√≥ la primera pel√≠cula: Michael, siendo el Don, organizando una fiesta importante para la familia que trata con un hijo que no quiere tener nada que ver con el negocio. Sin embargo, mientras que con Vito todos eran‚Ä¶  
7645  PERJALANAN TOBAT MICHAEL CORLEONESebuah penutupan dari sebuah trilogy The Godfather.The Godfather yang kali ini menceritakan tentang perjalanan seorang Michael Corleone dari awalnya dikenal sebagai iblis dan berusaha untuk membenarkan jalan hidupnya dengan berhenti melakukan segala tindakan kriminal dan menyimpang agama.Gw bingung kenapa Coppola bisa lupa dengan cara dia memperfectkan film ini padahal seperti yang kita tahu bahwa film pertama dan kedua dari trilogy ini benar benar epic tetapi mengapa film ketiganya ini hanya bergantung kepada ¬†ending dan acting dari‚Ä¶  
7646 alors c'est clair que c'est le moins bien des 3 mais c'est pas non plus mauvais j'aime bcp les 30 derni√®res minutes c'est les + int√©ressantes, pour le reste c'est pas tr√®s dynamique mais c'est qd mm trop cool et trop styl√© et j'aime TROP le personnage de Vincentdcp avis g√©n√©ral sur la trilogie C EXCELLENT ET MICHAEL CORLEONE EST LE PERSONNAGE FICTIF LE MIEUX √âCRIT DE TOUTE LA TERRE voil√† regardez cette trilogie c merveilleux vive le parrain 
7647 eu demorei a assistir esse pq n√£o queria ver t√£o cedo o desfecho da trilogia, mas esse aqui foi t√£o bom quanto os outros dois primeiros, um pouco arrastado mas ainda bom, com a mesma ess√™ncia.eu achei que o vincent uma hora ia derrapar e ia se voltar contra o michael mas eu amei ele, √© o sonny todinho. senti falta do meu querido tom hagen e amei a connie tendo mais maturidade. e eles introduzindo a sicilia foi A homenagem ao vito, eu amei, amei tudo, um √≥timo desfecho pra trilogia. 
7648 Ought to come with a warning: "You may overheat from '90s-era Andy Garcia and Bridget Fonda." 
7649 Not a bad movie, just not a great movie.¬†I too would be a terrible actress if my father was directing me in an incest sub plot, with another terrible actor. 
7650 The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael CorleoneIt‚Äôs a good film. Not sure how much the changes made for this new edit help as I‚Äôve not seen the original, but very much enjoyed what was going on here. A great epilogue to the original duology. 
7651 pacinos best performance is on this poster. that dead look in his eyes as he quietly tries to sniff his fingers. he knows you can tell. that‚Äôs the POINT. he‚Äôs the godfather, bitch. he can sniff all day long, but he disguises it because of his values. 
7652 really the only things I liked about this film were Anthony, and being able to see Michael's regret after being an ass in the second movie lmao. 
7653 olerem ay maykl. sene gelen keder qem qusse derd mene gelsin. 
7654 what the fuck is going on in here on this day 
7655 How's this for a hot take: I prefer this over The Godfather Part II. The plot and characters feel far more compelling here; a sorta Godfather meets Gordon Gecko meets Vatican intrigue. Michael's character feels fully rounded and the addition of Vincent is an interesting and welcome one. Even Sofia Coppola's performance didn't bother me. Sure, her tone is pretty monotone throughout but I feel like I've met plenty of people who's default manner of speaking is spaced-out/bored. Consider me pleasantly surprised, The Godfather Part III is much, much better the second time round. Recommended. 
7656 time to try and absorb these films into my personality 
7657  There are so many things to hate in this movie: the incest, the overwrought acting, Sofia Coppola, Andy Garcia, the blah cinematography, Sofia Coppola, the destruction of everyone‚Äôs prior characterization, the amateurish lighting, Sofia Coppola, the entire opera sequence, the terrible pacing, Sofia Coppola......but you know what I hated most? Well, I‚Äôll tell you. The entire gnocchi scene. And let‚Äôs talk about why it was so bad.¬†That was the most piss poor gnocchi prep on this earth. That‚Ä¶  
7658 Even Data from Star Trek has more emotion than freaking Sofia Coppola and he‚Äôs a god damn robot--I think what pushes this from ‚Äúmeh it‚Äôs just meh‚Äù to ‚Äúholy mother of god what did I just watch‚Äù is the fact that both part I and II are so good 
7659 Zasa! 
7660 I don‚Äôt love the new ending, even though I understand and even agree with what Coppola is going for. The original was absolutely perfect and one of my favorite parts of the whole trilogy. But every other editing decision taken by him before those last 30 seconds elevate a film which I already liked within reach of the pedestal occupied by the previous two masterpieces.¬†In future viewings, I‚Äôll just switch discs when they get to the opera house, same thing I do with Apocalypse Now Redux. 
7661 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   This is a review for the Coda version, which at the time I wrote this review, had its own separate Letterboxd pageHuge improvement on the original cut, they cut out so much of the bullshit and replaced it with actual information vital to the plot. But... a few issues I had from the original cut still carry over. Here is a list of them:1. Sofia Coppola is still in it and is still terrible, luckily her screen time‚Ä¶   
7662 Going into this; I expected Marys character to beguile me, like a Maria Antoinette type character. However, after actually watching Sofia Coppola as Mary the virgin, suicide is all I could think about. ¬†I'm on the rocks about this piece as a whole. Some of it shined like a bling ring, whereas other parts just felt lost in translation. Somewhere out there is a good finale, unfortunately it's not here. 
7663 Come on, it's actually a good film 
7664  "Run at thunder, girl! Thunder can't hurt! Harmless noise! Bullshit! You deceitful old fuck!" - Al PacinoThe Godfather Part III. What a boring, sluggish melodramatic mess of a film. I remembered liking this a lot when I was like 10 but...just...no. This does not hold up in the slightest. While not a TERRIBLE film or THE WORST FILM ever made, it's a ridiculous cash grab. Nobody wanted to make this film aside from Paramount. The production behind the scenes‚Ä¶  
7665 what was i thinking when i gave this a positive score?still a bad cannoli though 
7666 Sigo manteniendo que no es una mala pel√≠cula. Pero prefiero pegarme un tiro en los cocos que a ver a Sofia actuando en otra pelicula 
7667 ‚ÄúMary, he‚Äôs your 1st cousin‚Äù‚ÄúThen, I‚Äôll love him first‚Äù¬†üò≥ 
7668 francis fart coppola 
7669 they really waited all those years for al pacino to get older......also: incest?????? incest?!?!??!?!?!??!? 
7670 I used to own the DVD box set of The Godfather films, and I watched The Godfather and The Godfather Part II while I had it. I purposely didn't watch The Godfather Part III because I had been told it was terrible.While it's nowhere near as good as the first two films, it's still an interesting movie with some great performances - Pacino before he goes PACINO! (HOO-ah!), young Andy Garcia, the always great Diane Keaton - mixed with a few less than stellar bits (glad Sofia moved to directing).I should've watched this sooner, to complete the trilogy. Glad it's under my belt now. 
7671 And the winner for best actress in a supporting role goes to... everyone but Sofia Coppola. Man this Godfather Marathon was fun. 
7672 ‚ÄúOh, God ‚Äî You hate me, you hate me.‚Äù‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt hate you. I dread you.‚ÄùI am GENUINELY, genuinely in shock and utter disbelief right now. That finale... oh my GOD my jaw literally HIT THE FLOOR 
7673 In the words of Sofia Coppola:"no" 
7674 pretty good. the actual story part of this was boring as hell in my opinion, but good new characters like vincent made up for it. sofia coppola was whatever - i didnt like her but i didnt think she really detracted from the movie that much. al pacino (as usual) just killed me, especially the scene where he confesses to the priest. all in all i liked it enough, my favorite aspect of it was definitely al pacino. andy garcia was pretty good also 
7675 Entiendo que "no es lo mismo" que las otras dos anteriores como muchos dicen, pero a√∫n as√≠ me parece una pel√≠cula incre√≠ble. Las actuaci√≥n del Al Pacino siempre consigue ponerme la piel de gallina y la historia de los Corleone sigue estando genial en todo sentido 
7676 "Michael Corleone: Never let anyone know what you are thinking."fair enough I won't let anyone know this movie is a massive let down üëçüèª 
7677 Words cannot express my disappointment. 
7678 ‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt kissed me hello, you know relatives always kiss" - bro, why does this movie have incest rizz üíÄüíÄ 
7679 This has like a couple parts that feel like a nice extension of Michael‚Äôs story, but overall feels like a parody of the first two movies. Yeah, Sofia Coppola‚Äôs pretty bad. Incest is also super normalized here. Michael‚Äôs trying to stop his daughter from marrying her first cousin but everyone but him and his son are for it.This should‚Äôve been pitting Tom Hagen against Michael, as they sewed the seeds of that very well at the end of part 2. Alas, they didn‚Äôt wanna pay Duvall. Oh well. 
7680 I love this movie, classic. 
7681  Definitely a Coda more than a Part III (guess which cut I watched). Michael is essentially no longer present in this entry. His life ended with the killing of Fredo. Any attachments he has here are merely inherited from his past. He hasn‚Äôt moved on from Kay, he‚Äôs still trying to legitimize the family business, and his own son won‚Äôt engage with the plan that‚Äôs been in place since his birth. This is a companion piece even in quality of‚Ä¶  
7682 The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael CorleoneNot nearly as bad as everyone seems to think. Sofia Coppola INNOCENT.Watched at home by myself. 
7683 not awful but there is a lot of farting about with the vaticanalso andy garcia has to be told multiple times that fucking his cousin is ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù which is simply a funny choice of adjective 
7684 Peut √™tre pas √† la hauteur des pr√©c√©dents mais tr√®s bon quand m√™me. Il est beaucoup plus ax√© sur la trahison, les amiti√©s ce genre de chose plut√¥t que sur du crime organis√© mais cets bien √ßa change.Sinon cets comme d'habitude la musique est parfaite, la Sicile l'est tout autant √ßa donne envie de voyager tout √ßa en plus avec le beau temps qui arrive la. Je pense que la plus part des gens ne l'ont pas appr√©ci√© √† sa juste valeur et n'ont pas compris le r√©el message du film. 
7685 A very nice conclusion to the trilogy that, yes, falls short of the quality of the first two, but come on... you can't really top that. I love the story of Michael trying to find forgiveness and retribution for all of the bad stuff he did. And, yeah, for some reason there's incest so that's a thing I guess but otherwise it's a great movie and closes things out really well. 
7686 Andy Garcia‚Äôs hair is like The Godfather: Part 2 of hairstyles.

7690 rip Mary Corleone you would‚Äôve loved Sofia Coppola 
7691 This reminds me of when my aunt in Italy tried to set me up with my cousin that lives there and a bunch of the old people in my family tried to gaslight me into thinking it was normal 
7692 Every time I watch this I stand by my opinion that there is no bad Godfather movie. The first two are two of the best movies of all time no one argues that. This movie is filled with flaws it‚Äôs nowhere near the greatness of the first two. I enjoy how this trilogy ends damnit. That‚Äôs the truth. 
7693 thank you sofia coppola for giving us nothing 
7694 I just didn‚Äôt care plus I have been trying to finish this for months 
7695 Last 20 minutes or so was wank and i‚Äôm not a fan of the ending and especially that weird subplot of mary and vincent.4/10 
7696  "I'll always love you.""Love somebody else."This is an awesome movie that could never lived up to the first two Godfathers. I really like this version of Michael, who has regained some of his humanity in his later years, but who remains convinced of his own evil nature. It's odd to actually root for him to forgive himself, because he's right to consider himself unforgivable. This is the completion of Coppola's critique of the American dream, an ending to‚Ä¶

7701 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  I will never understand why there has to be an incest sub-plot in this movie. What was Francis Ford Coppola thinking?? There HAD to have been a better way of handling all of that.  
7702  ‚ÄúWhy was I so feared, and you so loved?‚Äùi think i liked it! it was a fitting epilogue to the trilogy, i liked the themes of the corleone family‚Äôs legacy. but in all fairness, i really do think that part 2 had the best conclusion. im not sure where to begin with this film, i mean, i feel like it‚Äôs missing the ‚Äòbite‚Äô that the previous 2 films had. it really doesnt feel like there was much more to‚Ä¶  
7703 Coda: The Death Of Michael CorleoneI haven't actually seen the original Godfather part 3 this one at least was really good it I did hear the complaints on the original part 3 so I looked into this one and it seemed as though most of the problems had been fix i mean it still shares some of the same problems from the original part 3 but it's a really good film never the less. 
7704 I liked this one the most! It‚Äôs actually interesting and the violence was done super well¬†I‚Äôm glad they only focused on Al Pacino, going back to Robert De Niros character in part 2 was SO annoying because his story was so lame and unnecessary but here it‚Äôs only Michael and thank god cause he‚Äôs so good in this, he just gets better every movie¬†A very good ending for a mid trilogy¬†The mid father 3 
7705 Movie just felt so unnecessary, too many new characters introduced that we kind of just don't care for enough plus there was zero need for that much incest wtf, felt like i was watching a mustie family reunion 
7706 in the first two godfathers, when someone is murdered, it is slow, silent, realistic. in this, a helicopter mounted with machine guns blasts a room of old dudes while one of them screams about his ‚Äúlucky coat‚Äù before he gets turned to swiss cheese 
7707 vibey 
7708 Definitely not my favorite of the 3 but it's hard when the first 2 were just that good. It still portrays well, from my historical knowledge, much of the struggle of the mob families to legitimize their business dealings and try to enjoy life in the later age of the mafia in America. Al Pacino performs brilliantly and I enjoyed Joe Mantegna in his roll. Definitely worth the watch if you were a fan of the previous 2 films. 
7709 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  i liked this well enough! note: i watched the coda version bc that‚Äôs what was available.¬†michael dresses up as mister rogers, diane keaton stays cool, and joe mantegna is wonderfully italian. we do not speak of sofia.¬†no - we do. did you know she barrels the camera, more than once? her dad really saw that and went, ‚Äúyeah no that‚Äôs great sweetie‚Äù. insane!now, i officially can no longer say that i haven‚Äôt seen the godfather. i‚Äôve completed cinema, i think.  
7710 if you watch the entire godfather trilogy on zero sleep, godfather iii will feel like a disjointed, vaguely absurd nightmare your brain cobbled together from pieces of the other two films and random concepts floating around your head (sofia coppola? the pope? incestuous cousins that exclusively call each other ‚Äúcuz‚Äù?). this is a real movie somehow. cool 
7711 there was just no need for the incest 
7712 even the poster is poo colored compared to the other 2 
7713 I‚Äôm sorry but I don‚Äôt feel that bad you can‚Äôt fuck your cousin. But that‚Äôs just me.There are some really interesting concepts in this film, but there just sadly aren‚Äôt enough. For instance, the ‚Äúmystery killer‚Äù trying to get Mikey, and finally exploring Mikey‚Äôs guilt. These are some great ideas, some explored more than others. A very tragic ending, as well. But that‚Äôs the life of the Mafia. 
7714 Absolutely equal to 1 and 2, which is to say, full of overplayed grandiosity and ponderous uninteresting violence that despite its technical competence, just misses me. 
7715  The funny thing about The Godfather movies is that - unlike Star Wars, or Indiana Jones, or Lord of the Rings or any other iconic franchise - their identity and reputation is not defined by lore or iconography but a widely-accepted belief that 'these are quite literally the greatest films of all time'. The Godfather Part III is unfairly treated and wilfully forgotten by people for the simple sin that it is a Godfather movie that is NOT quite literally‚Ä¶  
7716 I swear on the lives of my children, give me one last chance to redeem myself and I will sin no more.Coda cutwhy is everyone hating on this? i feel like this is a better sequel than part 2 ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 
7717 What?I knew people considered this to be bad, but the first 30 minutes feel like the most surreal and bizarre moments from The Sopranos. The line delivery, acting, dialogue, it's impossible to take seriously. Imagine Jackie Jr just became a character in The Godfather and that's what it feels like.Anyways, I thought the whole movie would be as funny as this so I was hopeful, but then it gets boring and there's even more of the awful dialogue and writing. What an unbelievable movie. 
7718 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  An extra half a star for Sofia Coppola dying. Amen to that. How did Bob Walters walk out of the first two and then proceed to say the third was a masterpiece? What a wreck.  
7719 Took them 16 years to decide the missing ingredient in the movies was‚Ä¶ incest. 
7720  Who the fuck said this was the worst one. This is one of the best movies I've seen, trilogy or not like damn.Everything was perfect, the cinematography, the acting, sets, story, it all worked and worked tremendously.

There are not many differences between this and the CODA, but the film is kinda the same, the pacing is a little weaker here but nothing serious.

7731  If it's so great an offense to fall short of the first two Godfather movies, then no one is innocent, and there are few films I'd forgive more quickly than this one. It may not achieve the same greatness, but it has so much of what made those two films so wonderful to watch. Despite being made nearly twenty years later, its tone and style are almost entirely consistent -- understated but beautiful visual compositions, scenes allowed to breathe and‚Ä¶

7733 Watched this only because I'm going to Sicily in two weeks & planning to visit Teatro Massimo where the last act takes place. That's it. 
7734  You know, the older I get, the more I adore the first two Godfather movies. They were instant favourites from the first viewing, but they still find a way to improve. The same can't be said for The Godfather Part III. What was at first an instant 5, has slowly dropped to a 3.5 over the years.I do believe that this final entry in the iconic trilogy is a fantastic gangster flick on its own merits, but really struggles‚Ä¶  
7735  If you're a die-hard fan of the first two Godfather films, Part III will feel like a betrayal. With Al Pacino and Andy Garcia, the cast boasts some heavyweights, but it's not enough to save this installment from its 2.5-star rating. Sofia Coppola's wooden performance is painful to watch, making it clear she's no actress.The pacing drags like a horse-drawn hearse, and the absence of the high-octane action that made the originals memorable is sorely missed. Instead, we're treated‚Ä¶

Overall, the only Godfather film I hadn‚Äôt seen before and I think it‚Äôs a very great underrated final installment in the trilogy.

I remembered liking them at the minimum and that still holds true, though I didn't adore them as much as the wide world does.

7743 The trilogy ended with lackluster. The plot was all over the place. I wasn't expecting to see a sloppy writing for this franchise but here we are. The incest storyline was so unnecessary, plus Michael atoning for his sins.¬†There were some great moments here and there but honestly, Al Pacino and Diane Keaton carried this third film and the production should thank them. 
7744 its definitely the worst of the trilogy but its still great, feels very separate from the other two as the tone and style are completely different. Coppola making his daughter one of the leads is chad behaviour, pretty cool this led to her directing as well. these films are all shot so beautifully, its like looking at god himself.

7747 I feel like some of this was actually phenomenal but also some of it was pretty bad. Sofia Coppola was not the problem though; so idk what a bunch of boomer filmbros are on about (misogyny probably).¬†Ultimately just feels like it retreads a lot of Part II‚Äôs point/message while also making a lot of nods to Part I. Diane Keaton, Andy Garcia, and of course, Al Pacino are great.¬†*donkey noises*

7764  "Just when I thought I was out they pull me back in."The Godfather: Part III was so much worse than the two classics that preceded it simply because the movie wasn't made with the same level of passion from Francis Ford Coppola.

He was right but of course, financial decisions come first and the studio Paramount‚Ä¶  
7765 Why was Michael the only sane one that was against that awful incest romance?

I totally forgot about the whole "we have to save the Pope!" bit.Today we watched Coppola's "final cut" aka "The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone."I did not like this new ending.Overall this movie did not need to be made.  
7767 Overhated movie tbh 
7768  Now although I do think this is definitely a step down from the first two films, it‚Äôs criminally overhated, it‚Äôs certainly a lot less interesting and the characters aren‚Äôt up to the standard of the first two (the exception being Micheal Corleone) and I also did like Vincent Mancini I think he‚Äôs a pretty cool character but apart from those two the other characters weren‚Äôt very memorableI did read a review on this film that not even Al Pacino‚Ä¶  
7769 Finally finished the trilogy and damn this one was boring.It doesn't feel like the other 2 at all. I didn't really like the romance plot they had going on and the vatican story was a bit weird too imo.The ending was intetesting but overall a really forgetable film. 
7770 No me gusta imaginar un mundo en donde el padrino III sea igual o mayormente mejor que la primera y segunda, literalmente hubiera dejado a los dem√°s cineastas sin la motivaci√≥n para hacer trilog√≠as.Nerfeada por el bien del cine. 
7771 Demorei muito para terminar esse n√£o vou mentir. S√≥ me prendeu na parte do teatro/musical naquele suspense em saber se o Michael vai morrer ou n√£o, n√£o √© um filme ruim mas n√£o chega no chinelo dos dois primeiros. 
7772 1000 MOVIEI am really happy to have finally reached the thousand movies. I picked this one. I am not disappointed but I am not impressed either. I wouldn't mind giving it a four if it wasn't a MASSIVE step down from the first two. 
7773 Si las dos primeras peliculas quiz√°s no me encantaron tanto como deber√≠a, esta ya mucho mucho menos. Si las primeras dos sobre todo la segunda, no me llegaron a enganchar, esta directamente me ha aburrido. Poco que salvar. Y sobre el final, sinceramente, no est√° mal, pero vamos, para hacer esto hubiese sido mejor terminar la saga e historia con el final de la segunda pel√≠cula. Me ha costado, pero porfin me he visto la trilog√≠a entera.4.5/10 
7774 This definitely wasn‚Äôt as good as the second but it‚Äôs not as terrible as some say. I liked the cousin love story even if Sofia you weren‚Äôt a great actress. But you made lost in translation so I‚Äôll forgive you. You look like dua lipa too. So I must have a type when it comes to picking wives. The ‚Äúmy lucky coat‚Äù scene was unnecessary and corny. It didn‚Äôt feel as much like a classic. But if you like this sort of thing I think it‚Äôs perfectly fine 6/10. 
7775 THE IRRELEVANT ONEüôè 
7776 Ruined my great Kung Fu Panda streak smh. 
7777  Definitely an improvement in the Coda cut. It's more focused and far less dull. In essence, it's shorter!A movie of a few magic moments - the confession, "they pulled me back in", the terror of the finale. Pacino, Keaton, Garcia, Shire and Hamilton (excellent in this) elevate the material - which largely seems to recycle too many ideas and narrative approaches from the two previous masterpieces. And the ascent of Vincent remains a far less convincing journey than Michael's.‚Ä¶  
7778  Se o estilo de vida do Michael afastou a todos da sua volta no final do segundo filme, aqui vemos mais das consequ√™ncias, na reta final de sua vida aparece q nada valeu a pena, de fato se tornando o "padrinho", mas se sentindo t√£o vazio ao realizar seu objetivo, sem nem total ci√™ncia disso, Michael entra numa jornada de tenta reconciliar sua rela√ß√µes e vida, quando se torna um homem mais vulner√°vel, mas os males desse estilo de vida‚Ä¶

7786 michael corleone em: tudo de ruim que poderia acontecer com uma pessoa aconteceu comigo 
7787  ‚Ä¢ Serviceable if bloated intrigue. Thematically weak, relies heavily on contrived parallelism to the first installment. Technically mediocre, though it does have massive shoes to fill.

7794 Vaya cierre tan perfecto para una trilog√≠a perfecta. 
7795  I have decided to give this movie my coveted "Not Actually As Bad As Its Reputation Suggests Award‚Ñ¢".I don't know, it's definitely a cut below Godfathers I & II, but I genuinely can't say that I thought it was all that bad. If you can stomach some fairly on-the-nose religious symbolism (which I can) and Italian opera (which I usually can't, unless interspersed with a large helping of suspense and some decently executed action scenes), this should have just enough‚Ä¶  
7796 You know what? Just bc of this movie, Kung Fu Panda trilogy >>> The Godfather trilogy 
7797 watched this while writing my personal statement‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. 
7798  Finally checked out this Coda cut, like I always say I do not understand the dismissal of this final film. It‚Äôs not even close to terrible, in fact the more I see it, the more I keep loving it. I think opening this cut the way they did was good, is it better? I honestly have no idea, I‚Äôve always been a fan of this one regardless. I will say this viewing today was definitely my favorite of this one‚Ä¶  
7799  I went into this with pretty low expectations but then quickly realized of course what I had heard was overblown. It‚Äôs not as put together as the first two, he‚Äôs trying lots of new things here and some of it kind of takes the film to a tone that wasn‚Äôt present in the first two films. There‚Äôs still so much artistry here and so much respect for its characters. It‚Äôs far more operatic with its scenes which makes sense given‚Ä¶  
7800 Actually wasn't that bad. I watched the Coda version so I'm not sure what the difference is to the other versions so I would have to look it up, but it was watchable. After all I read about Sofia Coppola's performance I was eager to see how bad it was and it was pretty fucking horrible where it turned out to be outright hilarious. This was obviously a major step down for the other 2 films, but it still was an entertaining conclusion to the trilogy. 
7801 Disclaimer: I watched the director's cut. I had previously heard some of the complains of The Godfather: Part III so I knew beforehand that it wasn't gonna be near the level of the first two films. Not really surprising considering The Godfather Part I and Part II together are pretty much perfect so there was no other way to go but down. With that said, The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone proved to be an interesting and somewhat satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, despite some casting choices, it all ended alright. 
7802 CODA - eh, I don't see a huge difference between this and the original version. Still don't like it, and I still stand by Andy Garcia being the worst actor in this movie. 
7803 The shortest of the three seemed the longest. He loses too much, the fascinating thing about the world of The Godfather, in addition to Michael, are all the characters that surround him, Tom, Sonny, Fredo, Clemenza, Vito, Clemenza, Sollozzo, Tessio and another one, here all the characters that accompany Michael are little interesting and don't help the plot move interestingly, Kay, Zasa, Altobello, Anthony, Connie, the only ones that make a real difference are Vincent and Mary (has to say Sofia acts terrible) 
7804  My Rating: 7.7/10IMDb Rating: 7.6/10Metascore: 60/100Undoubtably, the greatest fault of The Godfather: Part III is that it follows two of the best films ever made. Sure, it is half-baked and not quite as layered as its predecessors, but that should not discount its standalone quality. What you get is a satisfied ending to the Corleone-era, mixed in with some deceit, lies and incest.¬†However, unlike the first two films, we see a very intrapersonal side to Michael‚Ä¶  
7805  I was always of the opinion The Godfather Part II does in its final moments what Part III cannot seem to manage in its entire runtime, the ships having sailed and the bridges being burnt with little else worth returning to. The recut version of the film entitled Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone is more conscious of its responsibilities as an epilogue than the previous edition, this cut whilst never reaching the artistic heights of its predecessors much less‚Ä¶  
7806 Ahhhh I hate that I didn‚Äôt like this, I was thinking heck the haters I‚Äôm going to spend $30 on the 4K because there all just liars. They didn‚Äôt lie and they were right, it kinda sucks. I‚Äôm not going to say why it sucked because I‚Äôm sure half a million people already did but gahdamn Sofia that was some awful acting üòÇüòÇ 
7807 I dunno what's going on with people who disown this one and love part II. I saw them both for the first time this week and they feel remarkably similar for being made 16 years apart. This one even has a couple of the most memorable images of the series. The Vatican banker hanging from a bridge comes to mind. Funny also that this one gets into Gladio-adjacent intrigue but only in a very shallow sense. The involvement of the CIA in Vatican affairs and even likely in the death of John Paul I is a much wilder story 
7808  Coda: The Death of Michael CorleoneNot sure about how this new cut subtracts Michael's literal death from the original Part III. Watching it for the first time back in high school, I felt that such an unceremonious demise was right for a character who spent most of his life exchanging blood and money in the name family. The image of an old man taking nothing but grief and abject failure to his grave not two minutes after watching his‚Ä¶  
7809  Truly, Coppola knew what was best for the saga when he called this¬†Coda. It consistently works best as an epilogue, when the pulpiest, soapiest aspects of this great American tragedy unwind in the same literal cul-de-sac its violent curse condemned it to revolve endlessly around, just slower and sloppier with time. The spiral staircase cruelly unveiled for a cheap Penrose trick, the ascension flattened to a dull and deadening repetition. Sicily fertilized its fields with crimson, cyclical vengeance long before‚Ä¶  
7810 not quite as solid as the other two but it had its moments. some of the bplot stuff was kinda dumb and convoluted; all the best scenes were the ones of michael being old and sad and consumed with regrets.... i know a lot of ppl dislike the ending but i think its good and it fits. also shoutout to the poisoned cannoli you'll always be famous 
7811  Version : The Godfather Coda : The Death Of Michael CorleoneJ'avais tr√®s peu de souvenir de cette troisi√®me partie donc, avec ce nouveau montage, j'ai eu l'impression de donner une vraie deuxi√®me chance au film. √áa n'accote pas les deux autres, un remontage peut pas faire des miracles, mais je crois que tous les fans de la saga doivent voir cette version l√†. The Godfather Coda est √† l'image de ce que Coppola et Puzo ont voulu faire d√®s‚Ä¶  
7812 THE anti mafia movie. Vincent killing those dudes at the beginning is a cinema shifting moment; so frigid, so not ‚Äúcool‚Äù. None of it is cool. But it‚Äôs not grimdark either, its flat realism and lack of narrative propulsion (movie is an ocean, not a lap pool) serve the humanity of the film. Because compassion is the undoing of all popular misunderstandings of the first two Godfather films. They‚Äôre all incredible films, but this one to me feels the most radical still. 
7813 (Watched Francis' newest edit, Coda: The Death of Micheal Corleone)Yeah, I haven't seen the original cut so I don't know how much better this is, but I really liked it. A fitting conclusion for the Godfather series that is primarily focused on the idea of whether Micheal Corleone can ever be redeemed. Absolutely loved the cinematography and the usage of silhouettes. The entire climax at the opera is lovely. As for negatives, The cousin subplot takes me out of it, and the business stuff is needlessly complicated, but otherwise, really good movie! 
7814 ‚Äúwhen i'm dead, i'm gonna be really smart‚Äùthis movie wasn‚Äôt necessary but it wasn‚Äôt a bad movie at all.btw the fact that al pacino never got an oscar for his portrayal of michael corleone is beyond me. 
7815 I‚Äôm gonna go ahead and say it. I absolutely loved this movie. Was it as good as part 1 and 2? No. Is it flawed? Yes? Is Sofia Coppola‚Äôs preformance one of the worst ever and drags the movie down by alot? Also yes. Does this mean its a bad movie? Absolutely fucking not. I cried 2 times in the film and im damn proud of it. 9.5/10 if you like the first 2, watch thisEDIT: A year later i take it back, this movie is not good if i ever rewatch i will explain why 
7816 look how they massacred my girl mary ‚Ä¶.. 
7817 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  This one was just adequate. The cinematography is great as per usual and the acting is still as phenomenal as ever (maybe except Sofia Coppola), but the tone ranges from being just like The Godfather to being NOTHING like The Godfather. Seriously, what the living hell was that helicopter massacre? It doesn't make a lick of sense and it serves no purpose in the story at all.  
7818 they were really just doing anything in this film 
7819  Who knew after 2+ re-edits of Apocalypse Now (1979) that Coppola would‚Äôve given that kind of attention to the right film. The Godfather III (1990) is definitely better for having been meddled with than not. Ultimately, the new cut is just an aggressive retrim, mostly focusing on cutting down the bloat and giving the film a tighter feel overall. I‚Äôm not sure why so many people go into this thinking they‚Äôre going to cut out a character, as narrative storytelling‚Ä¶  
7820 No, I don't think there's anything to be misunderstood about this one 
7821 N√£o entendo a galera que fala mal, sim entendo a Sofia Coppola √© p√©ssima, atua√ß√£o merda, romance porre, o Andy garcia t√° s√≥ ok, pelo menos o Al salva l√° e tem umas cenas pqp de ruim, dasofia fazendo massa pqp, mas esse filme como finaliza√ß√£o acho bem bom, √© muito inferior aos 2, mas ainda acho bem bom nota 8/10 
7822  The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone (2020)This particular cut of Francis Ford Coppola‚Äôs The Godfather Part III (1990) is way overhyped in my humble opinion and not just by the critics, but by Coppola himself. I was expecting more than I got, especially after the director‚Äôs teasing introduction. Something along the lines of Apocalypse Now: Redux (2001) with its inclusion of deleted scenes would have met my expectancy levels, but that wasn‚Äôt to be.The original start‚Ä¶  
7823  The problem with this movie is that we all know it's backstage drama. We all know Coppola's financial struggle at the time, the Wynona thing, the little creative freedom, the Pacino-Duvall money problem, the lack of time for rewriting, even editing, all those things. But you know what? even with all that, the movie is actually more than good. Too convoluted? As are the other two movies, the plot is very complex and confusing most of the time in the‚Ä¶  
7824 Walau beberapa aspek yang bikin2 film sebelumnya luar biasa, tetapi konflik dan alur di film ini masih sangat menarik diikuti dan masih banyak memorable moment 
7825  My memory of this movie was that while it wasn't as good as the iconic first two, it was still very good and wrongly maligned. After watching it again (for the first time in maybe three decades) I readily admit I was wrong. I do think that Sofia is a scapegoat in a film that isn't at all her fault. It's true that she isn't very good, but neither is anybody else (except maybe Andy Garcia). Al is in over-the-top‚Ä¶

7828  **this review is for the 2020 The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone re-edit**taking ford coppola at his word, that this is meant to be an epilogue to the first two (and was always intended to be), the name change alone fixes many issues i had with the original part III.streaming era brain worms has me feeling like this is like a quick HBO miniseries, and in many ways it works much better that way. to me,‚Ä¶  
7829 This shows that you can escape your actions but they will never stop bringing you pain. What a freaking trilogy 
7830  The Godfather Part 3 is an underwhelming movie that feels unnecessary to the story. It lacks the charm, significance, enjoyment, direction, and passion that is noticeable in the first 2.¬†I take many issues with this film, but first I‚Äôll start with the elephant in the room. Sofia Coppola cannot act for shit in this movie. As a new character who we are supposed to connect with, she makes it really hard with her one note and stiff performance.¬†I‚Ä¶  
7831 it‚Äôs all that brats fault marythe plot is just as fucking good. just stunning but just terrible actors and characters since they didn‚Äôt have most of the old onesAND WHY INCEST WHY. WHAT. 
7832 The film was beautiful. Some of the line delivery was a bit cringe. Is it the weakest one in the trilogy? Maybe. Do I want Sofia Coppola to carve her name onto my chest with a rusty razer? Yes. I started crying in the theatre. This is a work of art. Definitely over hated. 
7833 Run at thunder girl! thunder can't hurt! Harmless noise! bullshit! you deceitful old fuck Altobello you fuck!!Fredo! Fredo! 
7834  This isn't a soul-less cash grab. The intentions were good. It just doesn't come together as a whole. Coppola's decline throughout the 80s is certainly to blame. He no longer has much command over his performers. The writing is very sloppy. The score and visuals are really all that carry over from the original 2 films. Yet there are some sweepingly high moments scattered throughout. The issue is, they don't carry much weight. The final conclusion at the opera house‚Ä¶  
7835 "just when I think I'm done, they pull me back"-myself this morning remembering there is in fact a third godfather movie 
7836 Not as good as the first two, but it‚Äôs tough to compare to two of the greatest movies of all time. I love this trilogy so much. 
7837 i dont like this movie 
7838  ‚Äúmary, he‚Äôs your first cousin.‚Äù‚Äúthen i love him first.‚Äùi‚Äôm starting off this review by saying that the re-evaluation of sofia coppola‚Äôs performance in this will be happening in the very near future, i‚Äôm sure of it (i‚Äôm still not fully sure if it should be re-evaluated, but i know that it‚Äôll happen!).additionally, the entire opera sequence is incredible, it‚Äôs truly some of the best filmmaking in the entire trilogy. also, i was going to say that¬†bridget fonda‚Ä¶  
7839 So, we finally finished the trilogy. This wasn‚Äôt as bad as we thought it might be. Andy Garcia did make it interesting! Al Pacino is definitely still Michael but trying to become more legitimate? I liked seeing Kay supporting her children. But Vincent & Mary? Nope.The ending was not as good as Part I but held fast to this story. I called the ending but was still shocked and felt like yelling, just like Kay.Also, watch out for the üçä üçä üçä‚Ä¶ 
7840 Mom and I's Godfather-athon comes to an end. 
7841  I chose to watch the theatrical cut first to see exactly what it was people have been sneering at for 32 years but I never found it. Sofia is an amateur but people make too much of amateurishness in acting. Her delivery of "dad?" at the end of the film honestly wrecked me. One man's wooden acting is another man's Bresson I suppose. Speaking of Bresson, howabout the shot of their hands making pasta?Part III is the closest of‚Ä¶  
7842 I would never call it the weakest film of the trilogy it's just the third most impressive in a absolutely unreal trilogy.The whole show sequence is outstanding, and keeps you gripped and on the edge of your seat, it makes the whole scene it's leading up to even more emotional. 
7843 Es gibt viel wunderbares im dritten Paten: V.a, wie sich Michael immernoch als der Gentlemgauner geeiert, der so etwas wie einen Moralkodex hat; wir wissen, das stimmt nicht. Wie er sich dann beschwert, die wahren Gangster w√ºrden ‚Äûheute‚Äú wo anders lauern.Sicherlich ist das Alles ein bisschen √ºberladen, aber ich denke man kann Coppola nicht dankbar genug daf√ºr sein, dass er nie den einfachen Weg in seinen Filme w√§hlte und auch im dritten Teil der Corleone Saga probierte, eine gewisse Radikalit√§t zu bewahren.Ich wage mich mal weit aus dem Fenster und behaupte, Teil 3 ist interessanter als Teil 2. Vielleicht nicht besser, aber interessanter.

7845 Michael Corleone concludes his descent by becoming a finance bro. Respect to Coppola for making his Banco Ambrosiono X The Godfather fan fiction include an incest storyline starring his own daughter.¬†That aside, CODA cut good. 
7846 Jesus christ, why too much exposure about this incest couple? So much unnecessary scenes, just give us a hint we get it...both of them are so cringey to watch.But I still appreciate the flow of the story it's still great tho but not as expected... 
7847 It was nothing at all compared to 1 and 2. Some of the acting was awful. 
7848 Glad Coppola gave the people what they wanted: a subplot about cousin fucking! 
7849 Atleast the incest wasn‚Äôt as disgusting as Al Pacino‚Äôs haircut. 
7850 Nothing like a love story between two first cousins 
7851 Lehet, hogy a leggyeng√©bb Keresztapa-film, de m√©g √≠gy is a legjobb gengszterfilm a Nagymen≈ëk √©v√©ben: (1) Coppol√°n√°l nem ripacskodnak a sz√≠n√©szek mint Scorsese-n√©l, akkor sem, ha ez√©rt h√°l√°s nekik a publikum; (2) prec√≠zen fel√©p√≠tett dr√°mai t√∂rt√©net zajlik epizodikus alvil√°gi katasztr√≥fa-turizmus helyett, (3) Michael Corleon√©t harmadj√°ra is lez√∫zz√°k egy k≈ëkem√©ny csal√°di/√©rzelmi konfliktussal (Pacino meg is h√°l√°lja, gy√∂ny√∂r≈±en) √©s (4) minden helysz√≠n megkapja a maga vizu√°lis j√°rand√≥s√°g√°t a Nagymen≈ëk d√∂gunalmasan egys√©ges k√©pi vil√°g√°val szemben - (5) Sofia Coppola annyira nem odaval√≥, hogy att√≥l m√°r kurv√°ra odaval√≥ lesz, ez az √©vtized legb√°trabb casting-brav√∫rja. (MOM, Budapest) 
7852 The fact this can lean on the first two really does cover a world of sinI wanted to know what happened to Michael Corleone, the score and cinematography are still great and it's that same world of intrigue that even when it's a little convoluted you find yourself nodding along with, it's so convincing. But the writing was so much weaker here and that was just it's biggest problem. 
7853 Coda Cut makes the movie significantly more parseable, less emotionally historonic and removes some of the more notoriously embarrassing scenes (goodbye seduction by gnocci).Strangely enough i am not convinced that any of this is actually to the film's benefit.Not sorry it exists but i think i'll stick with theatrical for my every other year trilogy revisit. 
7854 They pull me back in!Uma das minhas favoritas da hist√≥ria do cinema. O filme j√° n√£o me pega TANTO assim, mas eu gosto. 
7855  The Godfather Part III is a dissapointing conclusion to what could have been the best trilogy of all time. Even if Ford Coppola is a great director, the rest of the elements in here are quite bland, making the film overall lackluster. Al Pacino is terrific; the film works best when it‚Äôs a psychological deconstruction of Michael Corleone. The attacks/death scenes are very well done as well.¬†My main issue is basically that I don‚Äôt like Andy Garc√≠a in general‚Ä¶  
7856 ü§åüèΩü§åüèΩü§åüèΩ 
7857 This is definitely an interesting one. I feel like there‚Äôs a lot here that works as a good bookend to the trilogy. There‚Äôs some great performances and an ever bigger ensemble. There‚Äôs the obvious casting of Coppola‚Äôs daughter that leads to some weird plot lines. The film can also try too hard to recapture the magic of the original. Overall, the film just doesn‚Äôt hit the mark of the previous 2. 
7858  Perhaps this isn't fair, but I couldn't help but think of the Cousin Oliver trope with regard to the character of Vincent. A new character added to an establish sitcom that throws off the dynamic somewhat. In this case, Michael Corleone - one of the best characters in cinema - is set to the side for much of the conclusion to the epic.No doubt he's still a player here. And there is *some* reckoning with the merciless moves he‚Ä¶  
7859  [The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone]By no means a bad film. There are some truly great moments in this which are sadly just bogged down by many very mediocre and uninteresting parts, like the fucked up incest subplot between Vincent and Mary, or much of Michael's business deals that I just don't care for. The first half of the film is especially guilty of sections like that, and I found the latter one to be superior in‚Ä¶

7869 Note: This is for the Coda cut, which is an improvement on a movie I've always had a soft spot for anyway. 
7870 FINALLY someone dared to ask the question: ‚Äúwhat if The Godfather was¬†mid?‚Äù 
7871 My thoughts haven‚Äôt changed much since I last saw Coda. IMO, I think general audiences who watch this concentrate too much on the surface level rather than the rich tapestry underneath. I also think it‚Äôs very telling that in the physical media release for the 50th anniversary, Coda gets it own 4K disc, while the original Part III is on a 4K Bonus disc. Makes you think. 
7872  I suppose this is the place for The Godfather Part III, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone, a dreadful title in light of this particular edit, which closes on a man putting sunglasses on for no apparent reason. There are elements of a coda, reprising old moments and charactersat the end of a piece. It is definitely the best form that I've seen of the movie (though I can't be sure which cuts I have seen). It cuts rather than‚Ä¶  
7873 ‚ÄúI love music.‚Äù - Michael Corleone 
7874  It‚Äôs a satisfying finale to the trilogy, but it can‚Äôt help but feel like the third wheel, after the first two are flawless.¬†There is a lot I liked here. The acting is generally good, and Al Pacino really gives his all one last time as Michael Corleone. Also certain scenes were great, especially the ending scene, which was super intense.¬†However you can‚Äôt help but feel certain issues. Some of the dialogue is pretty weak, and some of the‚Ä¶  
7875  Not nearly as bad as I had been led to believe. Watched the 'Coda' version of the film - not sure how it differs from the theatrical version, but I think it's more tightly edited as the runtime is a bit shorter.Just a few thoughts - Sofia clearly should have taken more classes before acting in this. Luckily she can direct and if this got her to that point in her career, then more power to it.But the‚Ä¶  
7876 I haven‚Äôt seen the *new* cut of this film yet, just the original.This film gets way too much disrespect, when it‚Äôs still a thrilling, dense and intriguing crime drama.Pacino‚Äôs Michael Corleone is one of cinemas greatest characters, and he delivers a terrific performance in his send off. Wow.I‚Äôll concede that the third instalment isn‚Äôt as good as it‚Äôs two masterpiece predecessors, but it isn‚Äôt a bad film by any stretch either.A fitting and bittersweet conclusion to the trilogy, intrigued to see the new Coppola cut eventually too. 
7877 Who can blame Mary for falling for her cousin, when her cousin looks like Andy Garcia!The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone fixes many of the issues that the original cut had, so much so that it almost feels like a worthy epilogue to Michael‚Äôs story.However, no amount of editing can fix Sofia Coppola‚Äôs acting or Robert Duvall‚Äôs noticeable absence 
7878 Watched the Coda version.Obviously not as good as the previous instalments - feels kind of like a TV movie, but it‚Äôs watchable. Poor Sofia , she‚Äôs not the greatest actress but she made The Virgin Suicides so I‚Äôll give her a pass. Andy Garcia has a pretty face but he is phenomenally hairy which I find off putting. Also Pacino gets the ‚Äòjust when I thought I was out they pulled me back in‚Äô line which was nice. 
7879 I saw the more recent ‚ÄúCoda‚Äù cut and even the new scene of sofia coppola saying ‚Äúi must go now. my planet needs me‚Äù and flying away couldn‚Äôt save this mess.¬†godfather 3: ‚Äúthe godfather 3 of movie sequels!‚Äù 
7880  This movie was truly baffling, it felt like a parody of The Godfather that would be on a TV in Home Alone 2.¬†Doesn‚Äôt mean it was irredeemable though, on paper this is an excellent film. Seeing Michael equally as sullen but more pathetic is a subversive decision, burdened by his familial connections instead of bolstered by them, and having to face a new breed of Soprano-esque crime bosses that render him defunct is theoretically brilliant. Equally, the 70s setting‚Ä¶  
7881 Would‚Äôve been a classic if it wasn‚Äôt so CRINGE 
7882  If Godfather 1 and 2 are the story of a good man who losses his soul, then The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone is the story of a man trying desperately to regain it and ultimately failing. I think that this solid story is definitely present in the original cut of Godfather 3 but this new directors cut trims away a lot of the fat in that film, creating a much more streamlined experience that allows Michael's arc‚Ä¶  
7883  There were some things that I really liked about this movie, but unfortunately overall, The Godfather Part III just wasn't terribly interesting and honestly failed to keep my attention for a decent portion of the runtime. The whole cousin thing was pretty weird, and the character of Vincent wasn't particularly interesting to me. However, I do feel like the overall story was wrapped up pretty well, and I thought the ending was very well done. Michael's change of heart and‚Ä¶

7888 porfin termine la trilogia üôèüèºa pesar de todo lo que habia leeido sobre la tercera entrega esta me parecio bastante buena y a la altura de la saga. Es obvio que las primeras 2 son superiores pero nada,¬†en verdad me gusto esta tercera parte con un gran cierre 
7889 El final de esta pel√≠cula me arruin√≥ la vida para siempre, no puede ser. Dir√≠a que era m√°s feliz sin haberla visto pero me gust√≥ tanto que es imposible. 
7890  Eh. All of the pieces are in place but it completely lacks any of the emotional resonance that the first two carry. I liked a lot of the framing and lighting choices and Pacino does a fine job, but for being the shortest in the trilogy this is a bit of a slog to get through. There are those few moments that do shine though, particularly some of the scenes between Michael and Kay and the very tense opera house‚Ä¶  
7891 The Lost Daughter was amazing but there are scenes in this thing that make you second guess if you're watching Sofia Coppola or Tommy WiseauThe two coldest lines and they happen back to back:"Tonight the Corleone family settles it's accounts""Fuck him"And the ending! Oh it made me cry. For its couple of misses, its hits more than compensate for me 
7892  Leave it alone, it‚Äôs perfectly fine! Of course it‚Äôs the worst of the franchise, there‚Äôs no question, I do have my issues with it: The plot is pretty much all over the place, most of the movie‚Äôs intrigue is only around Vincent and Mary, which was weird as hell.

7894  What an incredible, bafflingly steep drop in quality from the first two. I‚Äôm not sure why, but nothing is as good as it should be. The acting is weaker, the script and story are worse, hell, even the music isn‚Äôt as good. For the first time in these movies, I didn‚Äôt care and I wasn‚Äôt engaged. I could not have cared any less about any of the characters (except Michael and Kay). However, it does have some good things, really‚Ä¶

7896 I've always liked Part III more than a lot of folks, and this is a great version of a great film. The climax remains breathtaking, as do several scenes along the way.(This was The Godfather: Coda, which I guess Letterboxd decided no longer gets its own page?) 
7897  The Godfather Part 3 is not the steaming pile of shite that it‚Äôs reputation would have you believe. Rather it‚Äôs an undercooked dish served by a director who was not only under studio pressure to complete a trilogy but also because he was bankrupt following some commercial failures in the early 1980‚Äôs.Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo‚Äôs story is good, but the screenplay is sketchy.¬†Al Pacino‚Äôs Michael Corleone is presented with an opportunity to reach the very highest‚Ä¶

7900 Tons of weird acting and story choices. Al was still good. I missed Tom.Coda version 
7901 You know if you recast Sophia Coppola (i know she was a last minute casting in this), renamed all the characters, amended a couple of plot points and called this something else, it would be more fondly remembered... Can we get this as the next redux version from Coppola, the non Godfather cut of Godfather 3 - "The Vatican Bank scandal". 
7902 Al Pacino's shitty old-age makeup is actually brilliant because it's a metaphor for how watching this movie ages you by 50 years 
7903  The often considered weak link of the trilogy, I can see that, it‚Äôs not as good as the first two nor do I enjoy it as much as the first two but it‚Äôs by no means the shit fest some people will have you believe it is. It feels different to the other Godfather films but at the same time it does¬†feel like the other Godfather films. It‚Äôs the one film out of the trilogy that Pacino didn‚Äôt get a‚Ä¶

7906 www.revistainterludio.com.br/?p=2593 
7907  This is definitely a controversial opinion: the newly re-edited conclusion to The Godfather trilogy is the second-best film in the series. It's meditative, completely ensconced in its characters and romantically symmetrical to the 1972 film, which in a way pays due homage both to Mario Puzo and to the original movie. I fully realize some folks will gladly point out how convoluted the plot is (it isn't) and that Sofia Coppola's performance wasn't up to snuff (it was), but I‚Ä¶

7914 Like any subpar sequel, The Godfather: Part III relies too much on tributing its two iconic predecessors. It certainly pales in comparison, but I genuinely admire that final montage. Finish it off with a gut-punch of a finale that suits as a fitting way to end the story of Michael Corleone.5.5/10

7925 I had a sick day so I didn‚Äôt go to school, I had time on my hands so I decided to watch this. It‚Äôs definitely overhated, yeah Sofia isn‚Äôt a very talented actress, but that still doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a bad film. I liked it yeah, but it‚Äôs for sure the worst from the trilogy.

7927 Was initially very hard on this but gave it a second viewing and felt it was a decent ending to Michael's story arc but i wished we saw more of Vincent as Don and the film is about 30-45 minutes too short imo. And Sofia Coppola's acting definitely gets this film a bad reputation. When you compare this to part 1 and 2, it's terrible but as a standalone film it's not that bad. But as it is supposed to be the epic ending to an incredible and iconic trilogy it is still a huge let down.

7933 Watched Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone.¬†I didn‚Äôt remember much about the original so I can‚Äôt really compare the two.¬†This movie is good but it‚Äôs just missing something.

7934 Grand and operatic, even though it is the weakest of the trilogy. The most violent and bloody film of the trilogy in some ways too. 
7935  When I heard about this cut, I assumed it would be essentially the same film, but made better through a new beginning, new ending, and some new edits here and there (with maybe some re-ordering of scenes). What I didn‚Äôt expect was for this film to get worse upon future viewings (compared to the first two: which I enjoy even more upon multiple viewings), but expected the edits to actually improve it somewhat.¬†Short-version: Andy Garcia is still phenomenal, the‚Ä¶

7946  Not sure if shaving five minutes really helped clean this movie up too much, but I enjoyed the new Coda edit more than the original cut. Probably just a time/perspective thing. Watching it without constantly comparing it to one of the best pieces of art ever conceived frees you up a little.

7947  While not on the masterpiece level of the previous two films, I've always felt this was a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy.

7952 Za-sa! 
7953  I have always put off watching the third movie for a collection of reasons. But when the Coda recut was announced, my interest was about as high as it would ever be. So I have no idea how different this is compared to the theatrical cut, but everything about this movie was solid. Sure, in comparison to 2 of the greatest movies ever made, I guess it‚Äôs nowhere near that level. But it is solid, and enjoyable nonetheless. In my‚Ä¶  
7954 Wow, alle haben gesagt der Film ist zwar ganz gut aber mehr auch nicht. Ich fand ihn ziemlich gut. W√§re ein eigener Film, mit anderen Namen und so, w√ºrde wahrscheinlich zu den besten Mafia Filmen √ºberhaupt z√§hlen. Da er aber ein Pate Teil ist und nicht an 1 und 2 rankommt steht er automatisch f√ºr viel schlechter da. 
7955  The experience and that lightning in a bottle of the first two films is so precious to me that I avoided Part III for years. I so wanted to preserve that sense of finality that Part II clearly had and everywhere I read it just pointed to a poor finale.¬†But did this story require telling ?A job of a sequel is to justify its existence. You build on what‚Äôs come before while also laying a new challenging path‚Ä¶  
7956  I'm revisiting The Coppola Restoration Blu-rays, Parts I and II, before watching the new "Coda" re-release of Part III.I've always been a supporter of Part III, whilst acknowledging it lacked that thing that made the previous parts the Titans of Cinema that they are.Retitling Part III to the orinigally conceived "Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone" might be the most significant change Coppola has made here. No longer are we to view this film as equal to its‚Ä¶  
7957 "Your sins are terrible. It is just that you suffer."The Godfather Coda: The Death Of Michael Corleone 
7958  Such a disappointing and mediocre end to The Trilogy. This movie doesn't have much to add in terms of the trilogy and has very stupid decisions that really make no sense in the spirit of the trilogy. There are many scenes in the movie that slow down the entire movie either reference back to the former movies or nothing at all. Character wise no one in this movie besides Michael aren't really that interesting at all with none of them‚Ä¶

Assim como Scorsese o faz em seus filmes de M√°fia, Em 'Godfather III' Coppola decide mostrar que o crime realmente n√£o compensa. Angustiado pela morte de seu irm√£o Fredo, Michael Corleone faz de tudo para legitimizar os neg√≥cios da fam√≠lia, mas quanto mais tenta sair,‚Ä¶  
7960 I know this film had a lot to live up to but...meh. Just not as gripping as the first two which are masterpieces. Bits of greatness held back by this film feeling overlong, the plot not being as interesting, and some not great acting (love your films Sofia Coppola but yeah). Also the whole incest plotline is just...why?!?!? Interested in the 2020 cut, but this was just not up to par.¬†50/100 
7961  The trilogy is complete. In a paramount run of only viewing The Godfather the past three days, I am tired. This one was made too far after the second one. People changed over the years and their reputations grew larger. I'm making assumptions. It seemed very stuck on glorifying the last few films. Characters weren't perfectly refined like they were. It's lost the dramatic nuance. They don't let the editing tell the story. And just because Part III isn't on‚Ä¶  
7962 Perfect for those who watched the first two and thought: You know what this franchise really needs? Incest!

7964  Stray thoughts on The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone: 1) Pacino‚Äôs work here is a powerhouse that is a great continuation of his work with Michael 2) Connie‚Äôs arc is so smart and Shire delivers trilogy best work here. I wonder if her character made bigger due to the lack of Tom Hagen? 3) Talia Shire‚Äôs costumes!!!!!! 4) the Michael/Kay trip through Sicily is as lovely as it is sad 5) the scene my pinned tweet references is‚Ä¶  
7965 First watch since I originally saw this a decade ago! Never quite justifies its existence, and Sofia Coppola and the lack of Robert Duvall are definitely problems, but the film is far from the disaster it's made out to be. Coppola can still direct the hell out of a movie, even when they probably shouldn't exist. Plus the opera climax and Joey Zasa's helicopter massacre make it worth watching alone. The Michael and Kay stuff in Sicily is really well done too! And Andy Garcia is legit great here, plus we have one of Pacino's best performances. 
7966  In every way worse than the other 2, except for Pacino, who remained fantastic. The obvious elephant in the room is Sophia, who Im very glad has mainly stuck with making really sad movies. She's very good at that...and not at this. The writing is sub-par, the characters are way more obscure and hard to keep track of, the acting overall isn't as good, the pace is terrible, and the last 45 minutes or so rip by compared to the‚Ä¶  
7967 Ya know i actually enjoyed the last 30 or so minutes. Everything that took place at the Opera I sincerely enjoyed, but the majority of the movie was... well not so good.¬†Also why tf was the theme from Raging Bull used at the end. Everyone who‚Äôs seen Raging Bull Bull will automatically thing of the iconic opening shot when they hear that music. I mean come on you could‚Äôve used any song. 
7968 Just watched Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone.¬†My god, it‚Äôs so much better. Not at the level of the first two, but a significant improvement. The story MAKES SENSE NOW. 
7969 The worst Godfather movie managed to be better than 90% of movies. 
7970 Wenn man sich durch die ersten 90 Minuten geschleppt hat, die weder spannend sind, noch irgendwelche denkw√ºrdigen Momente haben, dann erwarten ein noch 90 Minuten die denn Vorg√§ngern w√ºrdig sind, die das Pate-Feeling aufkommen lassen und mit einem denkw√ºrdigen Finalen beendet werden. Die Frage die bleibt. Ist es das beim n√§chsten Rewatch der Pate Filme wert? 
7971 i agree grown ass al pacino 
7972 ‚ÄòThe Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone‚Äô Review:Overall a much more satisfying view than the original theatrical cut. Much better paced, easier to follow and far more interesting. Whilst not perfect and still nowhere near like the first two, it does at least feel like a proper conclusion and an actual Godfather sequel. Crazy what shuffling the scenes around to change the pacing, adding in new music queues to make scenes more dramatic and cutting minor scenes out can actually improve a film.¬†However one thing is for sure, all the editing on earth can‚Äôt change Sofia Coppola's acting. 
7973 It‚Äôs quite a massive feat to land the high that The Godfather films were on. Sure, Sofia Coppola‚Äôs a little bland, but I don‚Äôt think it detracts from the rest. I would‚Äôve liked to have seen Andy Garcia get to go a little further and push the foil character further. All of this is really about Al Pacino. He gives a really committed performance with some great moments. The runtime feels short in comparison to the second but this is still quite overlong.

7977  30 years later, the general critical consensus on Part III is pretty well-documented, but it‚Äôs worth reiterating this isn‚Äôt the cinematic¬†disaster it‚Äôs sometimes misremembered as, nor is it anywhere near the greatness of the first two. If you can get past the fact that we never needed to continue this story in the first place, the bullet point version goes something like:The Good- Strong performances from series regulars Pacino, Keaton, and Shire. Newcomers Andy Garcia and Joe Mantegna‚Ä¶  
7978 This is for the new Coda cut.I had seen Godfather lll one time. I remembered very little outside of Sophia Coppola being not great and Al Pacino entering the gravel voice period of his career.¬†I found it very satisfying this time. I don‚Äôt know if it was the new cut, or just my perspective changing. I like that Michael Corleone has put himself in a world he can‚Äôt escape and that his life choices have made it so he can never find happiness. While it doesn‚Äôt hold a candle to the first two, it‚Äôs still a nice epilogue to the series. 
7979 Watching The Coda Cut as my first time watching any cut of this movie. It's like Coppola's The Irishman in a way, but, like, I didn't hate this. Maybe it's just me all the bad talk I've heard about this or that Coppola edited out all the bad stuff? Idk, but it's overall not as harmonious or powerful as the others, and I think making Vincent the son of Tom Hagen would‚Äôve been maybe just a little less disturbing? And also more thematically interesting, since a non-Corleone blood relative would be running the family. Who knows

Between the re-arranging, entire removal of and trimming of scenes, shortening of the film‚Ä¶  
7983 Okay, this is not a flawless masterpiece, but it's still a bloody good film. Obviously Pacino doesn't look (or sound) as good as he did in the previous two films and Robert Duvall is a big miss, but it's still a great story and a pretty good conclusion to the trilogy (or epilogue to the duology). Pacino still nails some of the scenes, particularly his confession, and Andy Garcia is good. And it's good to see Franco Citti (star of many Pasolini films) given a bigger role.Now looking forward to seeing the re-cut version. 
7984  Antes de tudo gostaria de dizer que Coppola inicia o pensamento desta obra num p√≥s estruturalismo colonialista anti-narcisista e a equipe do Letterboxd ap√≥s meu encarecido pedido para o uso da impactante imagem de Sofia Coppolinha sendo baleada em ‚ÄúThe Godfather: Part III‚Äù, eu fui censurado por supostamente se tratar de um spoiler. Mesmo eu mandando outra imagem que n√£o havia spoiler mas havia Coppolla, eles disseram que j√° estavam felizes com o Backdrop usado. Logo, percebemos que a equipe‚Ä¶  
7985 Fine. Andy Garcia was fucking awesome and Al Pacino was good. A few good scenes here and there. But Sofia Coppola and the fact it is fucking boring at times makes it a big fucking oof. Andy and Al make it a 6... maybe a 5 who knows aha. Review of the 2020 Coda Cut btw. 
7986 I have seen the first two Godfathers many times and consider them two of the finest films ever made, yet had always resisted part III despite owning the box set for about 15 years, probably because I always heard it was far inferior to it's predecessors. It really isn't a bad movie if you can look past a few questionable performances, but unfortunately is going to look much worse when placed next to the first two parts, which were based on Puzo's original novel, unlike the third. You can't fault people for high expectations here. 
7987 The Death Of Michael Corleone, can‚Äôt find the new version on here.Not sure how much better it is than the original as I haven‚Äôt watched it in years. I did enjoy this, the middle gets a bit boring but once the opera starts it‚Äôs pretty great. 
7988 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  I would have liked this better if Fredo (and John Cazale, RIP) were still alive. Definitely not as bad as people say, but also definitely did not need to be anywhere nearly as long or incesterous. I like to think Sofia Coppola saw this movie and said, "You know what, maybe I should try directing instead."  
7989 I watched The Godfather Coda re-edit. A better edit than the theatrical ‚ÄúPart III‚Äù but still no where near as good as it‚Äôs predecessors.

7997 I realize that what I just watched was a different experience than what most people have seen over the past 30 some odd years...a movie that has grown over time with a reputation now being ‚Äòredeemed‚Äô with what‚Äôs supposed to be THE final cut as originally intended...But what I just watched was a damn good movie and heartbreaking conclusion for Michael Corleone. 
7998 it disappeared from letterboxd but this is NOT the godfather III, it is The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone 
7999  It seems that director Francis Ford Coppola has entered his "Charlie Chaplin" stage. I say that because at the later point of Chaplin's career he had trouble getting new products off the ground so he went back and re-edited a lot of his films. It seems that Coppola is now doing that as many of his older movies have been re-worked and now we get to THE GODFATHER PART III.During the introduction to the film Coppola says that the‚Ä¶  
8000 Pure opera. Coppola‚Äôs changes make this version much smoother and more engaging. However, the lack of special features on this release is an enormous disappointment considering 2020 marks the 30th anniversary of GODFATHER III. 
8001  Version watched was The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael CorleneNever was going to be as good as the first two Godfather films, but not as bad as many say. There‚Äôs nothing really new in this edit, just some scenes moved around, mainly at the beginning and end, but still an epic tale of a family and it‚Äôs failings. Some great set pieces, though nothing quite matches those from Parts I and II; the helicopter attack on the New‚Ä¶  
8002 I know it seems unfair how much grief we‚Äôve all given Sofia Coppola for the last thirty years over this performance, but I‚Äôm here to tell you, maybe we didn‚Äôt go far enough.But really if One From The Heart was a hit we‚Äôd never have to suffer through that injustice in the first place. 
8003 The only GODFATHER movie where you can say, ‚Äúit goes all the way the Pope!!‚Äù If your biggest issue with this series is a lack of scenes involving the catholic church, this‚Äôll be your favorite one.¬†Years ahead of the curve on the whole incest thing. What a bizarre subplot that is actually kind of the main plot? Sofia is as bad as you‚Äôve heard in this and I like to think the casting of the guy who plays Tony, also bad, is to balance it out.Edit: Letterboxd removed the CODA listing so just clarifying I watched the new CODA cut #CODA 
8004 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   This review is about The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone, not the original cut of The Godfather: Part III. I reviewed that earlier this week. That can be found here.TWO STARS OUT OF FIVE. Coda doesn't have its own Letterboxd page so I have to review it as another viewing of The Godfather: Part III and not the mildly different movie that it is.The Godfather: Part III is a flawed movie but it has merit to‚Ä¶   
8005 Did this film have anything new to say about the Corleone Family? I say no, it did not. 
8006  Watching the recently released version, The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone.I'm not entirely sure what Coppola has tweaked, but I certainly enjoyed this more than I did the original version. Certainly it still suffers from the famously ill-advised nepotistic casting - but Sophia Coppola's amateurish performance would perhaps not seem quite so bad and jarring if it wasn't that she is surrounded by such phenomenal actors. Al Pacino gives one of his strongest and most nuanced performances‚Ä¶  
8007  The Godfather Part III is not a bad movie, but The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone might just be a bit better. It‚Äôs hard to nail down whether my rating jump from 2.5 to 4 is down to the recut or simply picking up more things on a rewatch, but I may put it down a little more to the latter. For starters, Sofia Coppola isn‚Äôt in this as much as I remember, and I may have been‚Ä¶  
8008 The greatest irony of all: my friends fell asleep when we watched the Godfather 2 together, so there was nobody there to tell me what happened after I dozed off during this. I hope Ron Howard takes his Hillbilly Elegy billions to do The Da Vinci Coda next. ("Coda" version - I thiiiink the stuff I dozed through was most of the significant changes?) 
8009  Finally got a chance to go back to the movies since seeing Tenet¬†in September. I‚Äôm definitely a part of the minority on this one because I really enjoyed the original cut of Part III¬†and I also really enjoyed the new Coda version.¬†The film starts with a nice introduction from Coppola as he introduces us to what he calls the ‚Äúdefinitive‚Äù version.¬†If you‚Äôre going into this hoping it‚Äôll change your mind about the original cut, you‚Äôre probably gonna be‚Ä¶  
8010 I want you all to take your disc 3/Godfather 3 Blu Ray or DVD‚Äôs or VHS‚Äôs and throw them away and replace it with this. Coherence is restored in the story, and the pacing at least flows this time around. Seeing this can make you understand why the film has been truly misunderstood for decades. 
8011 Part III > Coda.EDIT: Letterboxd have confused things by combining the two listings since I posted this diary entry, which was intended for Coda. I stand by my opinion, though. Part III has always been a strong film and I don't think the alterations were necessary. 
8012  Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) has reached an age where he wants his family to go into legitimate businesses but soon the guilt of his past is catching up with him as he tries to right the wrong he has done but it doesn't sit well with everyone in the family.THE GODFATHER PART III has one major and fatal flaw that has haunted it since it's release in 1990 and that's the fact that it's not one of the greatest‚Ä¶  
8013 cant get past the fact that mary was in love with her first cousin 
8014 It's been a long time since I saw The Godfather Part III so I have no idea the differences, however I do remember I liked it okay though a far cry from the first two. So now with this Coda version, the one Puzo and Coppola initially wanted, it does serve as the intended epilogue to the saga and it's well made and, for the most part, finely acted though Sophia Coppola did have one questionable scene, though her others weren't too bad.I'll be interested to read a complete breakdown on the differences but as a whole it is a well made drama . 4.0/5 
8015 It's like... everytime I watch it I simultaneously like it more and ALSO reaffirm how inferior it is to the previous two. 
8016 not as bad as people painted it to be... like the famous horse from the 90's show "horsin' around", Bojack Horseman once said: "You never get a happy ending, 'cause there's always more show." so its pointless to be mad hahah 
8017 nem o cl√°ssico de poderoso chef√£o se livrou da maldi√ß√£o de decair na sequ√™ncia. embora n√£o seja t√£o grandioso e bom como os primeiros, ele √© necess√°rio para o desfecho das consequ√™ncias das atitudes do michael como padrinho. e o final √© po√©tico e coeso... 
8018 This movie is good. Sofia Coppola's performance is fine. Francis set his own bar too high I guess, putting any film up against two of the best films ever made is a rough ask and even though it's not near the level of those, it's far better than the cultural reputation suggests.The ending? The opera? Absolutely slaps. 
8019 honestly... it wasn‚Äôt that bad. from what i had heard, this film is one of the worst ever. it definitely wasn‚Äôt as good as the first two, but it had a lot to live up to. this is 100% the weakest by a mile but it wasn‚Äôt that bad. 
8020 "In today's world, the power to absolve debt is greater than the power of forgiviness"Se existia algum jeito melhor de terminar a trilogia sem ser com toda aquela sequ√™ncia maravilhosa na √≥pera, eu desconhe√ßo.Gosto da forma como o conflito aqui surge ironicamente por uma tentiva de distanciamento de Michael, mas que constantemente √© afetada por seu relativismo moral. Mas seria essa tentativa uma procura por reden√ß√£o ou pela vida? 
8021 Weirdly incoherent, unnecessarily melodramatic for most parts. Even Pacino isn't very impressive. The final opera sequence however is fantastic and makes it worth watching.

8029 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   more of an epilogue to the towering first two parts of the trilogy but it's still interesting to see how things pan out for 'Michael Corleone' and his remarkable family. everyone's a bit older and wiser in this one, especially Al Pacino in the lead as he tries to keep his business relatively clean in these, his later years. it's up to a fiery Andy Garcia and (a slightly wooden!) Sofia Coppola to provide the young blood which they end‚Ä¶

8033 People always trash Sophia Coppola‚Äôs performance in this film. That is the least¬†of this film‚Äôs¬†problems. 
8034  This turned out to be pretty disappointing. Honestly, everything up until the end was alright, a little mediocre and mellower than its preceding films but still alright but then we got hit with the ending where everything just collapsed. Another problem was that it was hard to remain interested as there weren‚Äôt as many compelling scenes that took place, causing me to get distracted. And when you pair that with the screen time of the film, it turns out to‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs very much a poetic ending to Michael and the trilogy - a look at regret, pain and sadness towards a past life that Michael doesn‚Äôt really want to acknowledge anymore.¬†Besides, I‚Äôd feel like I was going against my Italian heritage to give this a bad rating.

8041 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Probablemente la pel√≠cula m√°s infravalorada de la historia.La direcci√≥n de Coppola sigue siendo magistral, y Pacino, Keaton, Shire y Garcia est√°n tremendos; eso s√≠, Sofia Coppola baja mucho el nivel general. Es una grand√≠sima directora, pero como actriz es nula. En qu√© momento se te ocurri√≥ tal idea, Francis...Toda la parte final, contrastando las escenas en la √≥pera con la realidad que est√° ocurriendo fuera (y dentro, pero a parte) de ella me parece sensacional. Y ese √∫ltimo‚Ä¶   
8042 The movie starts with narration, that already speaks volumes about the downgrade.Also incest? 
8043 16 Tahun pasca sekuel pertamanya, memang seharusnya Paramount tidak begitu tamak dan rakus dengan kejayaan dua prequel pendahulunya yang sukses besar serta memberikan pengaruh besar di dunia cinema.Seharusnya Paramount tidak memaksa dan menghargai keputusan Coppola untuk tidak membuat installment ketiga ini yang serba flop. Sofia Coppola yang turut bermain di sini pun tidak menambal apapun.Aspek naratif yang lemah, beberapa kualitas akting para aktor dan aktris baru yang serba mlempem dan memang sepatutnya The Godfather tutup pada installment keduanya 
8044 Cara, que tristeza, que solid√£o. N√£o vou me arriscar escrever uma cr√≠tica sobre nenhum da trilogia, mas esse e o 2 foram os que mais mexeram comigo. Coppola traz muita dor na maneira que comp√µe suas imagens. Toda a sequ√™ncia na √≥pera √© um dos momentos mais tensos que j√° vi num filme. Ele faz uma encena√ß√£o que evidencia o peso dos pecados do Michael em todo aspecto da linguagem. Obra-prima. Um dia escrevo um texto pra cada filme, mas hoje quero s√≥ sentir. 
8045  It's unfortunate that arguably the two best American films ever made were followed up by this mediocre and depressing watch of a film. Pacino, Keaton and Shire return and they're all fine, Pacino turns in a good performance but he's really just playing the gruff shouty card. Andy Garcia is a good newcomer but Sophia Coppola is awful, she's so damn wooden, her scenes are painful. It shocks me that this film is written by the same men who did‚Ä¶  
8046 The Godfather Part III, It's not as bad as what people put this one out to be like, it's no where near as good as the first two. Also, it's still got some brilliant scenes throughout and yeah, it might have a few stupid ones also throughout but it's not a bad movie. Finally, the cast aren't that bad but overall, it's not that bad of a movie but it's not a masterpiece like the other two were.I think I noticed with this one was that there wasn't enough action in total whilst with the previous two there was a good amount.

8051 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Ven√≠a ya avisado de que esta pel√≠cula no era la favorita de muchos pero tengo que romper una lanza a favor de ella, he de reconocer que tiene un comienzo muy bueno y un desenlace (para m√≠) excelente PERO la parte central de la pel√≠cula a veces se me hace muy densa y lenta (salvando algunas escenas, obviamente). Al Pacino brilla en muchas de las escenas, sobretodo en el final y en la confesi√≥n de Michael, √©l es "El Padrino",‚Ä¶   
8052 Buena, pero no maravillosa; al final resulta el mismo plot que nos contaron en las anteriores con menos punch. Eso s√≠, Andy Garc√≠a est√° excelente. 
8053  In retrospect, The Godfather Part III plays like a prequel to The Sopranos, so it will be interesting to see whether the series‚Äô own prequel film, Young Tony, will play out in terms of the iconography of Francis Ford Coppola‚Äôs 1990 film. The second episode of The Sopranos opens with a short scene ‚Äì the only scene in the entire series that starts before the credits in this way ‚Äì in which all of the main Mafia characters vamp on‚Ä¶  
8054 Bem mais politizado, √© atemporal e contempor√¢neo. 
8055 Bastante por debajo de las dos anteriores, y sin embargo, no es una mala pel√≠cula. Tiene sus cosas buenas, como ese puntito crepuscular (aunque sea una l√°stima que no lo exploten demasiado) o el final en la √≥pera.En fin, ya he terminado la que es probablemente, la trilog√≠a de pel√≠culas m√°s importante de la historia. Se siente bien cuando al fin ves cl√°sicos tan universales como El Padrino. 
8056  I seriously avoided watching this for so long but it‚Äôs GOOD?! It definitely didn‚Äôt have the same atmosphere and for me the intense moments didn‚Äôt hit as hard but if you hadn‚Äôt seen the first two that was objectively a GOOD MOVIE y‚Äôall are just meanmaybe it‚Äôs because of the huge gap between watching the 2nd and 3rd but I just feel like I can‚Äôt say a good movie wasn‚Äôt good just because it should have been GREAT. It‚Ä¶  
8057 Not a bad film by any means but yeah, it‚Äôs pretty disappointing when compared to the other two. Apparently Coppola only made this after Paramount strong-armed him into it, and it shows, but there are great moments littered throughout especially the scenes with Pacino and Keaton. I also appreciated how in keeping this was visually with the other two, Gordon Willis doesn‚Äôt disappoint. However, thank god Sofia Coppola‚Äôs a good director because she gives Keanu in Dracula a run for his money in wooden acting. 
8058 It's not all bad, but it's not a classic either. The intensity, the dread, the intrigue, they're all there, but they don't match the quality of the first two epics. I weirdly loved the opera sequence and the finality of the end nails the tragedy of this whole saga. I think Talia Shire and Diane Keaton were great here. 
8059  It's funny I've owned this movie for years but have never seen it. Mostly because I've heard jokes my whole life about how Godfather 3 sucks and how it's the worst one and ya it's the weakest of the bunch, but hey, if you're going to buy the other movies why not just get the set. However having watched it finally I'm not sure why I avoided it as long as I did. There is definitely value to be seen‚Ä¶

8061 ‚ÄúFriendship and money ‚Äì oil and water‚Ä¶‚ÄùThis is not a patch on the first two films which are masterpiece‚Äôs of cinema , this one should have made the Godfather the greatest Trilogy ever. But somehow Coppola missed the mark , and instead we got this long dull affair. The relationship between Pacino and Garcia ¬†is the only thing on note in this film. 
8062 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   ‚ÄúNever hate your enemies it affects your judgement‚ÄùGodfather 3 is usually considered by everyone the worst movie of the trilogy and a major stepdown from the previous 2 and for a good reason honestly but the movie does a lot of good things too by having amazing the direction,lighting,cinematography like so many shots of this movie couldve easily screenshoted it and put it as a picture on my wall its that good. And ofc the performances for the most‚Ä¶   
8063  Well, I did it. I watched all three movies of The Godfather trilogy in one day. It was quite the journey, and I think I‚Äôll treat myself to some cannolis.I think 3 stars is a fair rating for this because...1) This was completely unnecessary. No one asked for a Part III 16 years after Part II.2) One of the main storylines is house Michael Corleone‚Äôs daughter falls in love with her first cousin?!?! Like what?? What is‚Ä¶  
8064  Michael Corleone, il noto Padrino affermatosi negli anni, √® ormai fisicamente stanco e apparentemente demotivato dal suo business. Non √® pi√π Don Michael mandatario di assassini (familiari e non); i suoi interessi si sono spostati verso la sfera del mercato immobiliare, delle quote societarie e sopratutto dei legami con la potenza della Chiesa (il film inzia proprio del Papa Paolo VI che nomina Michael commendatore).Nonostante il Padrino non riesca pi√π a tenere il polso fermo della situazione, egli deve‚Ä¶  
8065 How can people not like this movie? It has Bridget Fonda in a leather jacket and nothing else. 
8066 7.0/10Part III contradicts a lot of what came before and feels like a forced addition rather than a proper continuation. It fails to live up to the legacy of the franchise. However I hesitate to say it‚Äôs a complete waste.It‚Äôs a fine movie. The acting for the most part (with one CLEAR exception) is still noteworthy and there‚Äôs a decent amount of scenes that gripped me. Somewhere in here is a great film, I do believe that. What we got though is a bit of a mess.

I also like how the film has Michael trying his absolute‚Ä¶  
8071 Why did I watch this movie? ¬†Better yet, why did they even make this? 20 years later.... it‚Äôs stupid. There‚Äôs nothing redeeming about it. ¬†Coppola‚Äôs daughter is physically painful to watch. ¬†I think it‚Äôs safe to say she‚Äôs a terrible actor. ¬†Flat, no emotion. I laughed when she died. ¬†That‚Äôs how bad it is. 
8072 no esperaba llorar pero pasaron cosas 
8073 it definitely lived up to my low expectations 
8074  These are gonna be my personal considerations on the whole Godfather trilogy. I doubt someone is interested in the thought of an unknown young girl, so I'll just write what I want to remember when I'll think about these films and I surely will. This was my first time watching what are considered as the best films ever made in the history of cinema and I was quite nervous in approaching this idea and wondered what makes them so popular‚Ä¶  
8075 that‚Äôs what mary gets for falling in love with her first cousin 
8076  I mean I think I like Part 2 just a hair bit better because the stuff with young Vito is so compelling to watch, but this was fantastic as well. I know this is the famous weakest one but I don't get the hate? It's beautifully directed, the acting especially from Pacino is incredible (Michael Corleone is one of the greatest characters in fiction), the editing is so tight. It's just fantastic. A fourth movie in the vein of Part‚Ä¶

8079  an opinion on this movie is probably quite clouded by the greatness of the first two, and how this one just sorta comes along as an afterthought over 15 years later. this one really does have some good moments though, but doesn't have the might to carry itself like the other ones did. it still runs with the idea of passing on the family business even further down the family tree; and having it turn into something almost entirely unrecognizable‚Ä¶  
8080 Lol how do you go from two masterpieces to this mediocre shithole 
8081 Positives - - that last half hour is extremely well done¬†- Andy Garcia is perfectly cast as an Italian gangster- provides a clear end to the trilogy and Michael Corleone‚Äôs story¬†- great music throughoutNegatives -¬†- Sofia Coppola is cringeful¬†- too much incest- tonal shifts through first half don‚Äôt fit¬†- no Robert Duvall¬†- story can be confusing- too much about Popes¬†If this was recast to have someone more experienced than Sofia Coppola and the return of Robert Duvall plus some changes to the story I think this may even match up to its predecessor

8084 Randomised Watchlist¬†- #1First film into this impulsive ‚Äúchallenge‚Äù and I‚Äôve already jumped the queue, it just felt like the right time to watch this. Y‚Äôall need to stop exaggerating how much this pales in comparison to its predecessors because I expected a full-blown shitshow but it‚Äôs undeniably quite solid and that‚Äôs coming from someone who absolutely adores the first two films. If you‚Äôre holding yourself off from watching this bc you don‚Äôt want to ruin the legacy of the Godfather saga just take my word for it and set yourself free, embrace the pulpiness!!! üëåüèª 
8085  Going into this, I knew of its reputation. I've heard how terrible it is and how awful Sofia Coppola is in it. I guess either I watched a different film than everyone else, or I am just not as discerning.I really enjoyed this. I don't think it's on the same level as the first two films, but that speaks more to the supremely high quality of those two films than it does to this one.Much like with the‚Ä¶  
8086 Baby's Day Out 2 
8087  In one sense a very unnecessary film and yet in another sense a elegiac film of literary stylings and idiosyncratic details far removed from the context of the original two films. In some ways more about the clandestine inner workings of the upper echelons of the Catholic church than about the mafia families, Part III really kicks in for me in the final hour. The scene between Michael and Kay in Sicily is a highlight. Their interaction at the house‚Ä¶  
8088  While The Godfather: Part III does do a good job of closing out Michael Corleone's arc as a whole this is a film that just never really feels like it was fully needed. This is especially apparent when factoring in Coppola's directing. While it's clear he had an idea of where to go this was clearly a film he made just to pay off his debt for his last box office bomb. The passion just really isn't here sadly and‚Ä¶  
8089  "Just when i thought i was out... they pulled me back in"yeah cino, yeah cinoCan someone conffirm me if i watched the right thing? That's the godfather third sequel right? Ok. It's like a Wes Craven movie met Twin Peaks and The Sopranos altogether and had a patriotic italian baby!!! (I only have seen the first one but i know what i'm talking about)- Sofia Coppola is in this cause yk she deserved, there was no one‚Ä¶  
8090 The Godfather: Part III succeeds in what it's trying to do, which is bringing Michael's story to a close, but it never reaches the heights of the first two films. Which is sad, because this film could definitely be written better.Also, I have to agree that Sofia Coppola is so much better at directing than at acting. 
8091  I think the reason I can‚Äôt ever really get into The Godfather III is that it has like GEORGE HAMILTON and ANDY GARCIA and JOE MANTEGNA interacting with THE CAST OF THE GODFATHER I AND II.The first two films are timeless. This one is full of 90s trash from the clothes to the hair to the cars even though it‚Äôs supposed to be the late 70s. Every new character sucks. It was expensive but looks cheap. Are we supposed‚Ä¶  
8092 o amadorismo da sofia, hoje, √© at√© charmoso. Um absurdo e grandioso final, do filme, da trilogia, dos Corleone. A sequ√™ncia da √≥pera √© fenomenal. T√£o bom quanto os demais e falo isso com toda tranquilidade. 
8093  The Fredo of The Godfather trilogy is actually tremendously underrated.While not perfect (like the first two arguably are, so in this case it is fair to say that), it's incredibly thoughtful and reflective and cuts quite deep.It is completely appropriate to take a cue from Coppola and treat this as an epilogue. I would also call it a mid-life crisis film that taps into real concerns of the life you left behind and the choices you've made.It‚Ä¶  
8094 The quality remains similar to the previous ones,the importance of family ties gains more relevance,Michael being withdrawn from past mistakes is a clear illustration of what his post can add to one's life: emptiness and the search for redemption.The protagonism given to the next man with the title "Don Corleone" is necessary,precisely,this sequence is essential to present the evolution of the Corleone and the course of each family's member,the outcome is unique,wonderfully dense.

8098 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Not awful or truly terrible, but pretty lackluster and boring overall. A couple aspects I like are Michael‚Äôs reconciliation with the priest and his reunions with Kay.Even with those positive aspects, this film just feels like it is in a different universe than the first two. It feels like a season of a wonderful TV series well past its prime, with only a few of the original actors still on board. The ending didn‚Äôt make much sense to me,‚Ä¶

8100  For the sake of positivity, here‚Äôs a list of things I like about this movie:-they matched the cinematography quite well to the original two. The shadows aren‚Äôt quite as deep but they nailed the colours.-Al Pacino plays weathered and tired and guilt-ridden quite well-it wraps up Michael‚Äôs downfall nicely, with a tragedy of his own making-some good references (even if they can be a little self-indulgent)-the whole opera sequence was pretty masterful actually (other than‚Ä¶  
8101  Imagine trying to follow The Godfather Part II. I mean, while it's not my favourite film ever, it's probably the best film ever made on a pure craft level. It's absolute perfection from start to finish in terms of writing, directing, the editing between the two subplots, the absolute thematic coherence, and that ending. Imagine making a sequel to that.No matter how good it was, The Godfather Part III was never, ever going to live up to the name‚Ä¶  
8102 They call it a Royale with cheese. 
8103  It's not bad, exactly, but it suffers in comparison to THE GODFATHER I & II, which are as great as they come. The storyline, largely centered on the Catholic Church being in bed with the mafia, is slack, especially in its third hour. As an actress, Sofia Coppola is a great director. The final scene tries to emulate the murderous climaxes of Parts I & II, yet something is missing: the players aren't clear, and it's too long and at times hysterical‚Ä¶  
8104  I think I like this film more than most people do. I don't think it completely ruins the other two and while it's a bit too long, I certainly found enjoyment in it. The directing, music and cinematography are all still on point. I also loved the way they closed out Michael's arc and it's always great to see Pacino and Keaton together in a scene.I thing I liked least about the film is that the modern aspects really‚Ä¶  
8105 If Francis Ford Coppola had just cut out what may be the weirdest and worst ending ever, cast Winona Ryder instead of his daughter (who is shockingly bad for all but the final few scenes of this), and focused more on Connie and Vinnie, this might've been the perfect ending to a perfect trilogy. Instead it's just alright, and as much as I generally hate the idea of sequels, I could stand to see them take another stab at sticking the landing here.

8108  This has been on my watch list since I made an account on this site back in February 2013. I never sought it out or went out of my way to try to watch it in any capacity because I heard so many bad things about this film. Having finally watched it all these years later I can understand people's frustrations with this film. The cinematography lacks the inspiration of the first two films and the writing and the acting‚Ä¶  
8109 love the way it detournes the earlier parts of the trilogy, converting its cynicism into pure human feeling. everything is now totally subsumed by capital in this world. the family business is corporatized and the don's job is just boardroom negotiations in skyscrapers. that's why the violence is more surprising here, and why it was a smart move to make it ridiculous and schlocky. 
8110 i accidentally read a spoiler so that ruined the ending for me :/also this isnt so bad 
8111 Tem todo um lance nacionalista nos dois primeiros filmes que nesse √∫ltimo n√£o existe. Eu entendo que os filmes v√£o evoluindo de forma que o modo de fazer dinheiro nos Estados Unidos tamb√©m muda, mas eu acho o patriotismo a cereja no bolo dessa trilogia. √â tecnicamente impec√°vel como n√£o se esperava menos mas √© o menos cativante dos tr√™s. 
8112  Don't really know what to think of this one. Of course, I'm in line with consensus in thinking Sofia Coppola is just horrendously cast, and she's playing a very bland character that the film's focus shifts to far too often, which is unfortunately a bigger problem because she's a crux of the whole narrative by the end. The rest isn't bad per se, it's just so dull. Michael suddenly feeling remorseful feels out of place, but it's a necessary narrative‚Ä¶  
8113 Not sure if I want to rate it as a stand alone film or in comparison to its predecessors...It just felt smudged up and unbalanced (the tone maybe?). Too much forboding music and oranges. I did like the way Michael looked at Kay when they held hands across the table. 
8114  Godfather: Part III has an inescapable reputation that boils down to two main points: 1) it does not reach the impossible heights of the originals, 2) Sofia Coppola's performance ruins the movie. Neither of these things are totally untrue. Yet watching nearly 30 years later, in isolation, with expectations set quite low, this feels like a special kind of old fashioned film we rarely see anymore. It's grand, it's elegant, it's beautifully lit - and it gives emotional closure for‚Ä¶  
8115  Leave the gun, the cannoli, AND this movie. After watching the first two films of the series, I was convinced part 3 would follow suit in excellence and tie everything up nicely (even though part 2 would have made a sufficient ending).¬†Honestly, the moment I saw a teenage Sofia Coppola playing Michael‚Äôs daughter, Mary, lusting after her first cousin, I knew this film was probably doomed.

8120 Not as bad as I was expecting. Unfortunately, Sofia Coppola's performance is. Not a huge bother to me though; she went on to become a decorated director whose films I greatly enjoy, while Winona Ryder was able to star in Edward Scissorhands, an incredibly more well written movie and one of my all-time favorites. 
8121  (For my thoughts on Part II, I think the second is even better than the first. Part II is pretty much two movies in one, and the sequel just compels and expand the universe even more, and I sure loved it.)For Part III, I was a little surprised that most people on Letterboxd rated this movie 3 stars. To me, that seems a little harsh. I get that most people compare this film to the others, which is understandable,‚Ä¶

8123 I realize I'm completely discrediting myself from any prior and future reviews/ratings, but this was the most entertaining film of the Godfather trilogy for me. If by any millionth of a chance someone has the same opinion, you should reach out to me cause we're obviously meant to be together. 
8124  This marks an interesting conclusion to the Godfather Trilogy for the way it extrapolates Michael out into the future and tests the theory that the more successful one becomes, the more crooked the enterprise. Michael wants out, and for the most part he is out, but in global politics on this level there's always moral compromise and corruption, as we've seen in each of the two other films.I think the film loses the focus of the series in a‚Ä¶  
8125 Everyone that says this is a terrible movie is wrong. The entire opera sequence is stellar and this is a fantastic and incredibly downbeat end to the trilogy.Also, once I had gotten used to Sophia Coppola, she wasn't bad. Plus, she was super pretty and so was Andy Garcia. 
8126  This is the first time I've watched it in its entirety. I watched parts of it on TV but the Sofia Coppola scenes caused me to change to channel every single time. Watching it this time, from the beginning, I wasn't annoyed with her. I don't know if it's because I watched it from the beginning or me growing as a film watcher (the last time I tried watching it, I was still in high school). With the Sofia business‚Ä¶  
8127  Released sixteen years after the second installment in the legendary Godfather series, I was hesitant to watch The Godfather Part III because, obviously, it has universally been deemed inferior to the first two films.Which I can see. How many third installments live up to the first two movies? Off the top of my head there's Return of the Jedi, The Last Crusade, Return of the King, and Toy Story 3.And upon watching this nearly three hour long feature,‚Ä¶  
8128  Part of my rewatch list. I was hoping the years its been since I've seen this much hated third outing into the Corleone family would give me some sort of new insight that would make me see it as an underrated masterpiece. Nope. Props to Coppola for actually attempting with a movie as its one of the few instances outside of the 70s you can actually see him trying to weave his craft. He fails more times than he succeeds‚Ä¶  
8129 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   As most critics I don't find the film unwatchable. Sure its not as perfect as the first two films but still a well made film. The expection were so high that after 16 years it was nearly possible to make a film in the same quaIity. + The film is beautiful shot, especally the scences in Sicily.+ The last 40 minutes are great. The symbiosis between italian opera and the assassination of the enemies. Its a nice reference to‚Ä¶   
8130 The most underrated movie of the trilogy and I really don't know why. It brings so many good things of the previous two movies.The only fault of the movie I can point it's Sofia Coppola and her awful acting. Besides that, a great, decent ending for one of the greatest trilogies in movie history. 
8131 Incredible to see how much Al Pacino's acting style changed between 2 and 3. I wonder at what point he lost some of his subtlety and just started barking. 
8132  Considering the first two Godfather films are legendary masterworks in cinema, the third film in the Corleone crime saga is a bit of a disappointment. The film lacks the sheer power and intensity of the first two films. The film is almost a dud, and despite it's legendary title, The Godfather Part III is an average film in the thrilling Corleone crime sage. Al Pacino manages to keep this film afloat, but Sofia Coppola takes it down a notch. This‚Ä¶

8165 It's okay.The opera scene was very well done tho. But the acting from Michael's daughter is pretty bad ngl. 
8166 unpopular opinion: i enjoyed this film so much. i expected it to be much worse, but the story was really interesting and emotional, i was on the edge of my seat for the last 30 minutes and even teared up at the end so it‚Äôs getting 5 stars from me, idc! maybe i get impressed too easily but this was great, i‚Äôm not gonna lie. the godfather¬†trilogy is truly legendary and amazing. i wish i would have watched it sooner!

8168  I know this isn‚Äôt the popular opinion with this film but aside from some general flaws and weakness compared to the first two, I think this film is still an incredibly beautiful way of closing the chapter to this phenomenal trilogy.In the first film, we see Michael sacrifice his goodness to serve his family. In the second, we see how his greed and desire of power turned him into a stone hearted man. But in this final film, we‚Ä¶

8172 Im going to be reasonable and say that if we got rid of the unnecessary incest full love angle and numerous occations of bad acting, we‚Äôd have ourselves a very good movie.¬†This film manages to briefly touch on some potential themes or story threads but hardly delved into enough to even warrant including in the first place. One example being how there is some remorce felt over Fredo but is only touched upon again a couple of times but never has any real consequence on the overall narrative or Michael.¬†Aside from some very obvious issues, im satisfied with how Michaels story was wrapped up.

Pacino is a very different performer by this time but his excessive stylings do often fit the melodramatic tone of this coda. If‚Ä¶

8179 If they cast Joey King instead of Al Pacino, none of this would have happened.

8181  the best part of this movie was the flashbacks to the first two films.here is my list of thoughts because i have too many:1. INCEST??? INCEST??? NOT ONE SINGLE PERSON TOOK THE TIME OUT OF THEIR DAY TO WARN ME THERE WOULD BE FIRST COUSIN INCEST??2. sofia coppola‚Äôs acting here was just terrible. really lowered the quality of the whole film3. imo the title really kind of spoiled the whole thing4. why were more ppl‚Ä¶  
8182 andy garcia in this movie looks like a hybrid of young robert de niro and luke wilson 
8183 Michael Corleone - "Never hate your enemies. It affects your judgement." 
8184 The Godfather III isn‚Äôt as good as the first two but it has one thing that the others do not. That is, of course, a cameo from Scorsese‚Äôs mother. 
8185 Pretty happy I finally saw this, the runtime went down quite quickly which I didn‚Äôt expect. The pacing and narrative are strong , and there‚Äôs a lot of great shots and framing too. Pacino is good and mostly restrained, all the other performances are pretty weak, I don‚Äôt think any are contenders for worst of all time but they‚Äôre not good.Not really a worthy follow up all things considered but still a great film to me that isn‚Äôt a disappointment considering parts 1 and 2 aren‚Äôt topped by most films in general.Highly recommended, top 10 of 1990. 
8186 I watched the new ‚ÄúThe Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone‚Äù cut.This works significantly better when thought of as an epilogue instead of a sequel. It doesn‚Äôt give you anything you didn‚Äôt get in the first two, but it codifies Michael‚Äôs damnation for time everlasting. 
8187 maybe the best third movie in a trilogy ever made. also maybe the biggest gulf between it and its predecessors. but it‚Äôs marvelous! 
8188 It's a shadow of the two masterpieces that preceded it but there are many moments that come close to reaching those same highs. 
8189  MARIO PUZO‚ÄôS THE GODFATHER, CODA: THE DEATH OF MICHAEL CORLEONENever hated THE GODFATHER PART III, but always felt something was missing. Something was wrong. It wasn‚Äôt until a few years after watching it, something I read in an interview with Coppola that forced me to look at the film in new light: he had never intended it to be the third part in a trilogy. Candidly, he had never meant to make it at all (read: this was a‚Ä¶

8191 After watching the 3 films still dont have a clue what actually happened. Spent most of the film being weirded out by the 2 cousins that were madly in love with eachother 
8192 for the first hour / hour and a half i enjoyed the movie, then it starts to be really flat and makes you completely divert your attention; i dont think its a worthy conclusion of the trilogy 
8193 The Godfather: Part III always felt like a cheap knock off of the first two films but I also always kind of liked it. I was hoping this new "Coda" version Coppola oversaw might present the movie in a different light, but aside from making it shorter (which is a good thing) and changing the opening to make it more concise and set the narrative immediately in motion, it's clear that the movie's deeper issues can't be fixed with a new "cut." Whichever version you watch, the movie is good enough as a stand-alone, but extremely disappointing when compared to the first two.

8200  I‚Äôve always been a defender of The Godfather Part III, which I feel is only guilty of not being as good as the original two masterpieces. So I‚Äôve been looking forward to seeing this re-edited revisit from Coppola. Outside of a revamped opening, and a slightly (but meaningfully) tweaked ending, not much has been changed, with just a few edits here and there resulting in a slightly reduced runtime. That may read minor, but the changes do make a difference.‚Ä¶  
8201  [THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE CODA CUT!]Didn‚Äôt think they would be showing the new recut of The Godfather, Part III in cinemas especially around my local area, but I‚Äôm glad they did.

8205  Wanted to rewatch the original before Coppola releases his directors cut on December 4th. The¬†Godfather: Part III gets a lot of flack, and that‚Äôs because it is compared with its predecessors.

8215 after the first two films set the bars for me, this third one really fell flat. not to mention the incest thing going on and i don't think anyone vibed with that. 
8216 Watching this movie was an eye opening experience really, this quarantine has truly changed me and it took watching al Pacino lookin like fucking Martin short in the Santa clause 3 for 2 and half hours to realize that. Who gave him that stupid ass middle school fuckboy spiky hair. he looks like he should‚Äôve been cast in spy kids.

8217  I'll go out on a limb here and say that if the previous two Godfather films didn't exist then this would be considered a great gangster epic. But then again, it needs the other two films to make sense so there we go.Anyway, I still don't get all the hate for this film, Yes, it's not as good as either of the other two but how many sequels made 16-odd years after their previous entry live up to a‚Ä¶

8219 Ve Godfather rewatch bitti. Part III‚Äô√ºn hala gideri var. 
8220 I like how they strategically made this film bad in order to highlight how good the first two are. 
8221 I think the movie won't make it's mind if Vincent's arc is supposed to be a cautionary tale that Michael can't end the cycle of violence or the story of his rise. Likewise the Rome plot is the equivalent of the trade federation talks in the Phantom Menace. Probably sounded very compelling in the head of the Director but very dull to follow in practice. 
8222 didn‚Äôt quite enjoy it as much as the second one. this would be the ‚Äúworst‚Äù in the trilogy

8224  Put the new Coda re-edit on, 20 mins later decided this ain't it and returned to the original.¬†As much as i like the idea of branding this story an epilogue and focus on Michael's Death, the grand poetry and ties to the first 2 films especially with new characters make it deserving of a full third part imo.I get the reception to this film, idk why the need to recut it to pander to that tho?

8227 But he's your first cousinThen I love him firstAbolsute genius, thank you, these words struck deep into my soul and made me cry out of cringe 
8228 what a disgrace to the series. a blatant, soulless cash grab, a laughably clunky script, character choices that feel cobbled together from fan theories of the time, and i'm sure it doesn't help that by this time, al pacino was at a point in his career where his acting had fallen into self-parody. abominably mediocre!!! diane keaton and my unending love for kay as a character is this installment's only saving grace imo 
8229 Death of Michael Corleone cut is superior except for the end. 
8230 Not as bad as people say. Although, compared to the others, it feels sluggish and directionless for long periods. but I had a fine time with it. 
8231 Ok je suis d'accord que c'est le moins bon de la trilogie, MAIS le film reste quand m√™me bon 
8232 Watched the CODA edit. 
8233 Disgusting. Lost all the magic that the 1st and 2nd movies had. It‚Äôs incredible how much the quality dipped. Where did the formula go? What happened? 
8234 It doesn‚Äôt have the feel of the originals, but Andy Garcia is good and Pacino gets better as the movie progresses. 
8235 What an awful ending of an awful ending to what could have been a nearly flawless trilogy.¬†While it wasn‚Äôt as bad as most people made it out to be, it‚Äôs true that Sofia Coppola‚Äôs performance is abysmal, unintentionally and ironically proving that nepotism is real. 
8236 Watched The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone without having seen the theatrical cut. 
8237 Everyone says this is the best Godfather but I'm not so sure. 
8238 three stars for the confession scene and the confession scene only 
8239  As unnecessary as a film can get. I‚Äôll be honest, Sofia wasn‚Äôt even the main reason I found this painfully bad in comparison to the first two chapters of the trilogy. It was more so because the entire story just felt pointless and often times kinda weird! Writing a conclusion to Michael Corleone, sure.

8251 i have a bone to pick with whoever decided that an incest plot was necessary 
8252 All the bad things about the first 2 films in 1 movie, also that nepo acting was bad 
8253 scammer get scammed 
8254 yeah i like this man 
8255 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   1.5 stars out of 5. It's not personal, Godfather III, it's strictly business.Michael Corleone does not feel like Michael Corleone. Something about his demeanor in this film compared to the second film was awful to watch‚Äîlike an itch that needs to be scratched (and it never does get scratched, ever). It is almost damning how his characterization here feels entirely separate from its predecessors.Where is Tom Hagen? Where is Tom Hagen? Where is Tom Hagen? Where is... This‚Ä¶   
8256 The third act is incredible, Diane Keaton and Al Pacino are just astonishing 
8257 Yay, I survived the three! Ya know, not as interesting as the first two, seems simplified - Mafia for Dummies - recycling many of their ideas and themes. But not much development, and sadly with a predictable ending.Would be interesting to refresh my memory of the original part 3, for comparison. But hey, it's still decent, fur sure. Guess this sh1t happens once you've killed all your 'interesting' friends, enemies & family off. Being legit, is obv overrated... **DOHfather 
8258  Definitely an unpopular opinion but this has a case to be my favorite of the trilogy. Part II may be a better film overall but I think I may have enjoyed Part III/Coda more. It‚Äôs a shorter film and a little faster paced which I enjoyed and I think it was the best performance by Al Pacino out of the three. The helicopter scene was also sick and I thought the ending was very good. I think it‚Äôs definitely underrated‚Ä¶

8260 The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone 
8261 Thus concludes Film 4‚Äôs showing of the Godfather trilogy. Whilst I‚Äôve read that the 30th anniversary version is better than the original I would be curious to watch the latter unfortunately unless the original has no Sofia Coppola and the return of Robert Duvall I doubt it would change the film‚Äôs rating¬†So excited for Megalopolis 
8262 decent enough i think 
8263  Putting The Godfather Part III defender on my r√©sum√©. And I‚Äôm NOT talking about the Coda Cut, either! (Although this does feel like it drags sometimes, really because some of the scenes in the film love to build tension before actually fully explaining what there is to be so tense about)¬†Michael Corleone is now an old man. He made his bed decades earlier and is now haunted by the ghosts of his past. We never see Vito, Sonny or‚Ä¶  
8264 Dogshit 
8265 Overhated 
8266  I was reluctant to watch this as I‚Äôve heard not too many favorable reviews especially in comparison to the first 2. But wow. I truly believe this final chapter in the godfather trilogy is just as good as the rest. Legit brought a tear (or few) to my eyes. Very beautiful shots, some of the best I‚Äôve ever seen in cinema if I‚Äôm being completely honest. Below are a few of my favorite quotes from the movie:- ‚ÄúThe mind‚Ä¶  
8267 The final film in the Godfather trilogy didn‚Äôt match the original two but it was a nice sequel nonetheless. I enjoyed seeing Michael and more development in the Corleone family story. The ending of the film was the highlight for me, it was devastating to watch but so well done. I‚Äôm sad i‚Äôve finished the Godfather trilogy, it was amazing to experience for the first time. 
8268 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Wait, this is incest!  
8269 Brilliant 
8270  Robert Duvall did right to deny this after finding out he wasnt going to get payed "enough" for it. Al Pacino is adorable in this. I mean hes not Michael Corleone, hes literally a cute guy trying to get by. Sofia Coppola is stiff if you are looking for a even worse actor I would say Andy Garcia. My reasoning for this is first his character being seductive by saying he dated 8-year-olds at 15 and getting on with his‚Ä¶

8273 Watched the Coda versionI feel pretty bad for Sofia Coppola, especially considering it seems like she didn‚Äôt even really want to do this, but she is by far the worst part here. And it only gets magnified even more when she‚Äôs opposite Pacino, which is like half of her scenes.Besides that, it‚Äôs unnecessary but fine. Obviously worse than the first two, but it‚Äôs not unwatchable or anything 
8274  ‚ÄúDo the donkey for me,‚Äù about sums this up.¬†What makes this most disappointing, in my opinion, is that the potential was there for a story that was both profound and creatively justified as a belated return to The Godfather saga‚Äîbut what we ended up getting was best left at the conceptual phase.Al Pacino‚Äôs performance as a desiccated Michael Corleone, paired with the character‚Äôs desperate campaign for redemption while in the throes of deserved torment over his decades-prior fratricide,‚Ä¶  
8275  The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone¬†Okay, so the story itself isn‚Äôt bad, it‚Äôs mediocre; it‚Äôs like that movie from the 80s/90s that your uncle is super nostalgic about and loves but you know it‚Äôs just whatever so you just let him have it‚Äîtoo specific?? The thing is, how do I put it, it‚Äôs like it fell from the heights of part I and part II and crashed right on its face. It‚Äôs just mediocre so it never‚Ä¶

8279 probably would have liked it more if my dad didn't pause every 20 minutes to explain why he named me after the antagonist üî• 
8280 Kinda stinky 
8281  Just an absolute disgrace. I can't even think of one thing this movie does right. The performances range all the way from middling to garbage with a ridiculous 90s Pacino and Sofia Coppola being about as good as the non-actors that Ken Loach picks off the side of the road. The dialogue is unnatural, characters change on a dime, clich√© scenes, and at times the film feels like a parody. It's hard to shake the feeling that nobody cared about‚Ä¶  
8282  kinda sucked. since the death of tony baminaboni in part 2 it lost a lot of it's driving force and they kinda wrote themselves into a corner, not to mention the lack of energy without him. baminaboni was essential to making the first two godfather films what they are. the film cheaply copies it's identity with the first two films and as such it loses everything that made the first so engaging. everything you liked about the first two are‚Ä¶

We all know that and it's best to just admit it off the top but the final act in this rules so hard that it leaves room for me to be a little softer on this than most people seem to be.

8295  A movie, I think, that gets caught up in a desire to achieve a similarly huge sense of scale as it's predecessors, whilst reckoning with their acclaim. I'm speculating, but it feels like Ford Coppola wanted to create an epic here- an American mythology, so I can see why a lot of story beats are echos of moments in the preceding films, but it comes off instead as a band's re-recorded greatest hits album with little of what made the‚Ä¶

8300 Watched Coda. (I wanted to watch the original theatrical release, but I literally couldn‚Äôt find it anywhere).¬†Considering I thought the first film was pointless, this one really didn‚Äôt even need to be made tbh.¬†It took me ages to get through it and I honestly considered not even finishing it at all, which I never do. 
8301 Part III has beautiful elements for a film, and definitely isn't a "bad movie". However when you consider it carries the name Godfather, what an embarrassment of a sequel and ending of the trilogy. Even though this has the shortest runtime among the trilogy it feels as if it's longer than the other two. There are many ridiculous and unnecessary features, im willing to act as if this doesn't exist. 
8302 Coda cut. The last 45 minutes (except for Al Pacino's make-up) are stunning, mostly simple, lyrically unadorned stationary shots, close or medium, of faces and hands and doorframes in beautiful wood rooms with red curtains and red flowers and, on the stairs, red blood. Gorgeous 1.85 compositions of decor and architecture and human frailty, and the editing in the Coda cut is quietly devastating. Such black blacks, those shadows, so dark, so deep...

8306  [CODA]The epilogue of The Godfather duology is a fitting 700th film. Ford Coppola‚Äôs definitive edit brings a whole ending to perhaps the greatest story Hollywood has had the graciousness to witness. He diverts from traditional mafiosa as seen in the prior two parts, to a tragedy. One especially similar to that of Romeo & Juliet. The success of this film is largely based in the humane (and underrated, I must say) performance Sofia Coppola brings, and the relationship dynamic between‚Ä¶

8310  Hmmmmm..... underwhelming film among other films sa The Godfather trilogy. Hindi niya nakuha yung vibes sa previous two films. Feeling ko dahil 'yon sa setting ng film which takes place in Sicily, Italy rather than in New York or Las Vegas. Also, medyo naka-focus kasi sa corporate things. Ok naman ang story. I like the character of Vincent Corleone assuming the control of the Corleone's (legitimate) empire. Medyo emotionally-charged naman ang redemption arc ni Michael Corleone. I also like the‚Ä¶

8313  You have to be honest with yourself; this is a relatively good movie. People hate it because it‚Äôs not 1 or 2. Those are all time great movies, where either can be considered the best ever. This, clearly, is not that.¬†The need to end the Michael Corleone saga simply had to happen.¬†Al Pacino is still great as Michael Corleone.

8314 This film, compared to the previous two, doesn't hold a candle to them. But, on its own right, this is still a very good films, and that ending really makes it work. This film is unfortunately just a shell of what it could've been. The writing, acting and direction just became sloppy and not as interesting as it should've been. It's really quite padded out as well. 
8315  I was overcome with the need to watch this movie, despite not having seen the first two in a long while. As anytime I watch an Al Pacino film, my reaction is always: That's Al Pacino???? For the first two hours I was prepared to say this wasn't that bad, but the last forty minutes confounded me. I could not understand who was killing who, or why... and it just felt very tacked on like "we need to end it‚Ä¶

8323 This movie was better than I expected, but is still a let down. Choppy edits, poor acting, and a story that didn‚Äôt need to be told. As a stand-alone it‚Äôs fine; however, as a part of The Godfather trilogy it‚Äôs disappointing.Also, Francis Ford Coppola must have really wanted to see his daughter die. At least, that‚Äôs the only explanation there is for him to have cast her. 
8324 bit of a snoozefest.. tho sofia coppola is so pretty here i almost didn't mind her awkward acting 
8325 yay incest 
8326  Look few films can compare to the original two Godfather films, and that‚Äôs why I feel Part 3 gets way too much hate. When it comes to a 16 year belated sequel to two best picture winners, it‚Äôs as good as one could of hoped for. I‚Äôve always been a defender of this trilogy ender, which is a strong film in its own right. Pacino at this point in his career was already hamming it up to unspeakable levels, so‚Ä¶  
8327  I can confidently say that there was a version of me before The Godfather trilogy and after it. I also think that I‚Äôve walked through it at the right time of my life ‚Äî I feel like a couple of years earlier I wouldn‚Äôt be able to emotionally or mentally connect to most parts of it, while watching Coppola's adaptation later, perhaps, wouldn‚Äôt teach me the things I took from it.What I didn‚Äôt know and what absolutely baffles me‚Ä¶  
8328  Coda CutI never thought I‚Äôd see Barbie products in a Godfather movie.If you‚Äôre comparing this film to the previous two masterpieces, the quality of this film goes down by a lot. However, for what it is, I still find this film a decent conclusion. Sofia Coppola‚Äôs acting is obviously the clear problem here, as well as the whole Vincent and Mary romance subplot, didn‚Äôt feel a thing there, and some scenes just feel tired and dull. BUT, there‚Ä¶

Such an all around awesome trilogy. My love for Pacino is so much bigger after watching these. Italians are so cool bro. Can't wait to possibly visit some of the places in these movies. I wonder what the Italians think of them.All 3 of these are going on my pending top 50.Such a tragic ending.Thank you Michael Corleone.

8342 The final film in The Godfather series. This is underrated, unlike the previous two, but it is, by a small margin, the weakest of the three. 
8343 hate to say it, but i laughed almost every time they said joey zaza 
8344 i don't think it gets enough credit for its better moments, & especially scenes like michael's confession or his conversation with kay are very well done even if the larger story they fit into is not nearly as profound as the first two

8346 Never hate your enemies, it affects your judgment. 
8347 "I swear on the lives of my children, give me one last chance to redeem myself and I will sin no more." 
8348 I can't believe how Michael changed from the first film, in which he was nothing like the rest of his family, an innocent man (at least at the beginning), to the second in which he became what he didn't want to become, a monster, and then in the third and final movie he transformed into a better man who wanted to leave the mafia business. Probably Michael Corleone is one of the best character ever created and for me he has the best character development in all cinema.PS: What an amazing actor Al Pacino is! I can't believe that he is from our world! 
8349 A √∫nica parte que eu realmente gostei do filme s√£o os minutos finais no qual a trama e a pe√ßa se tornam um s√≥Fora isso, esse filme √© uma bela maneira de como finalizar uma trilogia pessimamente 
8350  Pretty clear to me in hindsight how the thrashing of Sofia Coppola's performance is just the misogynist cover for everything else that is wrong here. She is nowhere close to the movie's biggest problems. Central to it in all honesty is Pacino's performance - his bearing and delivery to me doesn't connect to what he did in Parts I and II at all, Michael feels completely different, beat down, his former power and poise barely present at all and the‚Ä¶  
8351 FTW for Coda - Death of Michael Corleone.Cannot speak on much authority on what has changed apart from the ending which I did think worked better without the outtake scene and the last frames in Sicily. Overall it all just seemed to flow better as on some days this would push ahead of the Original for me but never higher than Part 2. Will always be a Sophia Coppola defender as she did achieve what she was asked to deliver which is an awkward young woman just finding her way in the world. 
8352 Oh come on people, I know it's the weakest in the trilogy and Sofia Coppola did a horrible job but it still rocks. What's wrong with you guys? 
8353 why people hates this movie it‚Äôs not that bad 
8354 It pains me to write this but definitely not captivating or as powerful as the first two films. It would be damn near impossible to understand this without seeing them first. Al Pacino does a great job but the character writing for Michael at this point in his life is subpar.Sophia Coppola is insufferable in this and her acting is repulsive. She is as about as animated and engaged as a corpse, no pun intended. 
8355  The Godfather III:A long way off being as good as the first 2 films. Some of the acting is pretty poor at times, the dialogue is questionable throughout and Sophia Coppola was truly awful. However Al Pacino carries the weight of this film all on his own back and puts in a remarkable performance considering all of the above mentioned and the ridiculous storyline. For his performance alone I give this - ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èListsFranchise Ranked Series - The‚Ä¶  
8356 Genuinely one of the worst decisions in cinema history. Whoever signed off on this needs to be committed. 
8357 Finished with the godfather trilogy this is by far the worst one, overall the trilogy was underwhelming for me I can't lie 
8358  The Godfather Redux or reflection upon grief. This one is problematic mostly as it has a strange DNA to it where it almost feels like a reboot at times, the bizarre incest plot line, and Michael coming to terms with his existence. The latter of these works really well, showing us a conflicted Michael Corleone still walking the right rope between learning from his father and being the despicable man he still is. The emotion from his scenes work well‚Ä¶  
8359  GRADE: B¬† ¬†I was too harsh on The Godfather Part 3 the first time around. In a vacuum It‚Äôs not a bad movie but It‚Äôs still a huge drop off from the previous two and has lots of issues. I‚Äôd compare this with The Phantom Menace. Long break for the series and it has so much to live up to and you know It‚Äôs not that great but eventually you just accept the movie for what it is. ¬†‚Ä¶

8362 sure it‚Äôs not all that but the godfather 1 and 2 didn‚Äôt have martin scorsese‚Äôs mom in it 
8363  Crazy that an Elvis Costello song is in a Godfather movie!I remember watching the theatrical cut of this when I was 12, right after seeing the first one. I hadn't seen the second one yet so needless to say I was confused, but I liked the more extreme violence. Since that was the last time I saw this, it didn't really matter to me which version I watched but I watched the Coda version.Of course, this isn't as‚Ä¶

8365  I have to say, for most of this film, I enjoy it much more than The Godfather: Part II. That is despite it clearly being the lesser in terms of craft and story. The Metrograph was playing this as the Coda cut, though I am not sure if that's a good or bad thing... I think what allows me to enjoy it is that I can once again like the protagonist. Especially compared to the incredibly annoying Vincent character. Michael‚Ä¶  
8366 This is a pretty good end to the trilogy. I agree that Sofia Coppola‚Äôs acting doesn‚Äôt cut it , but it hardly ruins the movie. I think this is a good send off to the Michael character with many of the ideas presented in the film effectively mirroring the first. It starts a little slow, but overall I actually think it‚Äôs better paced than the second one. It‚Äôs a good movie, not a great one, but worth seeing at least once. 
8367 Hot take, but this was my favorite of the trilogy ü§ê 
8368 Sofia sweetie, just stay behind the camera, ok? 
8369 It‚Äôs fine 
8370 (Original Cut)Sorry but Vincent is hot This was good and I think the hate is a bit much. Yes the film is sort of pointless but I think the film is shot beautifully. Sofia's performance is just decent not horrible and I don't think it really ruins the film. Weridly I think it ends a little abruptly for being almost 3 hours long. I'm interested if the Coda edit is better/worth watching. 
8371 not the best part but the last 30 minutes of this movie made me cry

8377 (original cut)I had avoided this film for years because of its reputation. It turns out that a great movie looks disappointing when compared to two masterpieces. I can't say I fully understood the intricate web of characters and connections in this installment like I did in the first two, but everything was still steeped in the gorgeous atmosphere that I've come to love. This is absolutely worthy of being part of the same esteemed tapestry. 
8378 i thank god everyday that sofia coppola went into directing and not acting 
8379 If this wasn‚Äôt associated with The Godfather, then people wouldn‚Äôt hate this film. However, as a Godfather installment, it is a disappointment. The acting is still decent to good, but the screenplay does not live up to its predecessors. However, this is not the worst movie ever made or anywhere near that tier. 
8380 Alright film. üëçIt's fine. Just kinda boring and definitely not up to its predecessors' level.

8389 far too much dialogue. assumes the audience is an idiot. completely lacks the subtlety found in the first two godfather films, especially found in the godfather part I. all of the elegant and measured characters have left the series, leaving only clownish parodies of 'mafia' film characters. al pacino looks ugly. that being said: sofia coppolla you did amazing sweetie but i don't give a fuck about the lame corleone children 
8390 Vergeleken met de vorige 2 is het duidelijk minder. Maar dit krijgt teveel haat. Het is op zichzelf gwn een goede film. Francis probeert dingen te doen die in de vorige 2 films werkten, maar het heeft niet hetzelfde effect hier. Betekent niet dat het mislukte. Hier en daar lukte het nog steeds vrij goed. Al Pacino is zoals altijd goed, maar het personage Michael Corleone voelde niet als dezelfde man als in de vorige 2. Het stoorde niet gelukkig. Het begin en het eind vond ik het best. 
8391  I might catch a bit of Hell for saying this but, aside from the unfortunate casting of Sofia Coppola as Sonny's daughter, this is a pretty damn good film.I do agree that the story should have probably ended after number 2. But. At least it was Coppola who returned to it. So now I must set aside my feeling that it should be made...because now I must review it on its own terms.What works really well is first‚Ä¶

8395 It's an awful feeling when I also hate a universally hated movie. Sorry king I can't defend you. 
8396 I‚Äôll be honest: I could barely follow what was actually happening in this movie. Maybe I just wasn‚Äôt in the right headspace when I watched it, but I had to pause and work stuff out way too frequently. Felt pretty anti-climactic, and like they rushed a bit of Michael‚Äôs story between the second and third film. I still think that everything here is technically great. Great performances, directing, editing, cinematography, and soundtrack. I just wish the execution was a tiny bit more satisfying after the masterful first two films.Thank you Al Pacino? 
8397 They should require every Disney exec to watch this before green lighting a new Star Wars/Marvel movie... 
8398  When realisation strikes Micheal Corleone, he takes a tough call and decides to end his family's criminal empire. He chooses his nephew as his successor, however, the mob refuses to let him go.After having seen the first two before, I finally watched the third one as well and as expected, it is not as good as the first two, but come on those are two of the best movies of all time. This movie feels like it is made,‚Ä¶  
8399  This is mostly regarded as the runt of the litter when it comes to the Godfather Trilogy. I don't even think it's necessary for me to say, but this is absolutely nowhere near the excellence of the first two, even if the degree of scrutiny it receives is too high.So, it has been just over twenty years since the events of The Godfather: Part II, and just under thirty five years since the beginning of The Godfather. Michael Corleone‚Ä¶  
8400 after seeing the rocco movie, i do appreciate most of the family values from the corleones, incest storyline put aside obviously bc that was weird. 
8401 Fine, this was just fine. Nothing else to it. Pacino acting was really good at the end. 
8402  Theres amazing moments scattered throughout this sequel for sure, but the film as a whole is a shockingly messy and disjointed sequel to two perfect films.The best thing is Al Pacino and Diane Keaton, they both give excellent performances that are true to their characters. The scenes between the two are easily the best in the movie in my view. Michael as a character is really interesting, he still has his same quiet demeanor, but every scene you can‚Ä¶  
8403 This wasn‚Äôt great by any means, but my expectations were so low I was surprised it wasn‚Äôt worse. There are a lot of questions, there‚Äôs some questionable acting ‚Ä¶ but, overall, its bones were better than plenty of other shitty movies, that‚Äôs for sure.¬†It was a long day to watch all of these movies back to back, but didn‚Äôt feel nearly as long as it could‚Äôve for these runtimes.¬†Thanks to all of our goofy friends who decided to also spend their day on this silly adventure with us.

Solo queda agradecerle a Coppola por hacer magia y volver a verla al menos dos veces por a√±o. Al igual que las otras dos, por supuesto. 
8415 Winona Ryder shouldn‚Äôt have dropped out ffs and where the hell is Tom Hagen? 
8416 While not nearly as good as The Godfather Part I & II, The Godfather Part III is still a decent film. Francis Ford Coppola still does a great job directing it, Al Pacino does a fantastic good with what he's given, and Andy Garcia was a welcome surprise, but it does not have the same charm, story, and depth as the first two. The Godfather "franchise" could've done without this film, but they made it, so here it is...Overall Rating: 7/10 üôèüë¥üèº 
8417  I went back after 10 years to see if I was a little too rough on this and all I gotta say, nope, this is wack. People love to say that if this wasn‚Äôt pitted against the previous 2 that it wouldn't be dogged on as much but that‚Äôs just not reality. There‚Äôs several reasons why I think this film doesn‚Äôt do it for me, first Sophia, enough said, second the story is just not gripping at all and most‚Ä¶  
8418 Look how they massacred my boy (Part 3). 
8419 Ultimately, despite its reputation, The Godfather III (specifically the coda cut) best showcases the consequences of capitalism and the endless illusion of accumulating inhumane amounts of money for "the better of everyone". Its new ending in particular, not only best shows the end to a brilliant character arc, but it also critiques in a rather poetic way that everything you start, will always have its end.

Perhaps if there was less incest it could have got 4* but it is what it is.There are some really nice parts, but they aren't expanded as much as they could be imo. I think we only actually see Vincent do anything once, yet that scene is actually pretty cool. Anthony is really good in this film, but he's only in like 5 scenes. The opera scene with him singing is possibly the best in the film.Al Pacino was amazing, as usual 
8429 First watch of ‚ÄòThe Godfather Coda: The Death Of Michael Corleone‚Äô hence no rewatch denoted here.Shame on Letterboxd that we can‚Äôt log this recut version as it‚Äôs own separate movie. Same issue for the variations of ‚ÄòApocalypse Now‚Äô, too. 
8430  Okei, jeg vil bare si det med en gang at jeg syns ikke The Godfather Part III er en d√•rlig film. Den er ganske grei egentlig og har veldig mange sterke elementer. Det er en fryd √• v√¶re tilbake i dette magiske universet og jeg liker at den graver dypere inn Michael og de rundt han. Det gj√∏r at den i det minste har en grunn til √• eksistere og funker bra som en epilog til de to f√∏rste siden‚Ä¶  
8431 Michael Scott was right. 
8432 The Godfather: Part III is by far and away the worst movie of the Godfather trilogy. It‚Äôs a movie that has a lot of potential to be a great conclusion to an epic masterpiece of cinema. Sadly it falls short of expectations because of such a meandering storyline. Al Pacino‚Äôs performance as an old Michael Corleone makes up somewhat for the movie‚Äôs shortcomings‚Ä¶but not enough to prevent viewers from wondering if maybe this third installment was even worth making.

8434 The Godfather: Part III may not reach the same heights as its iconic predecessors, but it's still a well-crafted and engaging crime drama that offers plenty of thought-provoking moments, Francis Ford Coppola's stunning visual style remains impressive, and the film's score is a beautiful and haunting reflection of the film's themes and the film also offers a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, and while it may not be as groundbreaking as the first two films, it still manages to hold its own. 
8435 Part III is a fall from grace and a low bar compared to its predecessors. Apart from a couple highlight moments, the entire film feels like a too little too late third act of a story that‚Äôs stuck in a bad 90‚Äôs flick. Vincent and Mary are annoying characters, the acting is awful and their ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù is cringe inducing. Al Pacino looks like he died and was replaced with a clone, also where‚Äôs Robert Duvall and De Niro?¬†I guess the producers made the director an offer he couldn‚Äôt refuse. 
8436 every person in this looks like they stepped directly out of 1990. did they even try to do 1979 at all lol 
8437  Here we go! ¬†Three days, and three mafia epics later, Michael Corleone is one of my favourite cinematic characters of all time. I think watching the Coda version of 3, rather than the original cut made this movie much more powerful. It feels like an add on, the ending of an individuals journey not his families. It‚Äôs much more personal, and feels more like it‚Äôs own beast rather than a continuation of events. That said, Sophia Coppola is dreadful and‚Ä¶

8440 Coda: The Death of Michael CorleoneOkay I knew going into this that it was gonna be a tough watch, but somebody could‚Äôve warned me about the incest. 
8441 -It's your favorite song, Michael, where you going?-I'm just gonna go into the kitchen and listen to some Tony Bennett records.Os fiscais do letterboxd que me odeiem mas eu achei esse o melhor dos 3 filmes 
8442 The Godfather Coda: The death of Michael Corleone.La trama de los primos enamorados fue la m√°s aburrida. 
8443  I mean it isn‚Äôt the worst thing ever? Maybe because I watched the new CODA version? Like the incest stuff is fucking weird, and Vincent‚Äôs character feels all over the place and he feels so unnatural in it idk I think if the successor was an already established character or Mary it would‚Äôve felt so much better. Tom Hagen is missed so much in this film. Quite a few things I disliked about the plot really, but it‚Äôs not awful‚Ä¶

8450 the DONKEY?????? HELLO?????and im not going to touch on the line about "he's my first cousin then ill love him first" because im sure it's been covered already. but GOD 
8451  Finishing this trilogy. Watched CODA. I don‚Äôt know this film well enough to fully know the differences. The first two are so perfect. This is a good watch to finish out the story and see Michael go out pretty much just like his father and end this tragic story. Andy Garcia is great. The shoot out scene in Atlantic City is wild! We all know Sofia is a bit rough. And I personally hate the cousins love story line. It‚Ä¶  
8452 okay so I hated the cousin thing but shoutout to the daughter ! am I rightcant believe we made it!!I would burn in hell to keep you safe 
8453 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  no he podido ni acabarla, entre primos no te arrimes  
8454 Kind of unfair to compare this film to the previous two films, but it is noticeably more convoluted and less compelling the previous two films.¬†But I can sympathize with Francis Ford Coppola, who wasn‚Äôt very interested in making another film in the first place. And I very much agree that this film was kind of unnecessary. Was it fun? Yeah, sure. Was it boring? Dragged a little bit.¬†Sofia Coppola has seen better days because oof. 
8455 Not as bad as the world led me to believe 
8456 Obviously not at all in the same league as it‚Äôs predecessors, but it‚Äôs also a huge understatement to say GF3 ‚Äúhas its moments.‚Äù Worst culprit btw is neither Sofia Coppola nor Andy Garcia, but the completely intolerable George Hamilton. (Coda cut) 
8457 We need to launch a full scale federal investigation on who allowed this 
8458  The movie really moves the series and characters forward in an interesting direction that falls in line with Michael's long term goals in the first 2 films. I watched the recut "coda" version of this film instead of the theatrical, so the narrative and pacing issues weren't there for me. However, it was clear at times that scenes had been trimmed and that caused the transitions to seem a bit off.My biggest issue with this was the character work‚Ä¶  
8459 Aqui ele se estende demais, apesar de ser o mais curto dos 3 ele fica com a sensa√ß√£o de ser o mais cansativo. O desenvolvimento dos personagens tamb√©m ficou a desejar, n√£o me importava com ningu√©m no filme, a vibe de m√°fia tamb√©m se perdeu bastante por avan√ßar no tempo e acho que tem muitas cenas desnecess√°rias ao longo do filme e o final entregue de qualquer jeito de forma extremamente acelerada depois de enrolar tanto. 
8460  After more than 30 years I was curious to watch the Coda Version. A generic, purposeless film, though. Surprised that the vast majority of the most important scenes felt like an interminable echo of the previous two, since every single one is a reminder of another, greater scene filmed in one of the two previous parts. Also, full wih an awful dialogue, unnecessary or poor description of all the major characters (Tom Hagen's son for instance or an unprepared mafia‚Ä¶  
8461  Review for ‚ÄúDeath of Michael Corleone‚Äù Coda version.How does this manage to be even worse than Godfather III? Coppola is on crack if he thinks he‚Äôs improved it. Other than a more restrained final shot it‚Äôs hard for me to pick a thing I like more here. Shorter is better but not if your shorter version truncates plot lines and character intros so badly it plays like kabuki theater for the mafia as written by a ten year old.‚Ä¶  
8462 this wasn‚Äôt that great but these Corleone bitches are my family now no one gets me like they do 
8463  Theatrical Cut‚ÄúJoe Zasa, would never pull something like this without backing. He's just muscle, he's an enforcer, he's nothing. He doesn't have the wit for that helicopter attack. He doesn't even have the ambition to wipe out the whole commission; certainly not the balls.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs a bit strange that Sky Movies is still showing The Godfather, Part III, given that Coda is in circulation. Still, it‚Äôs nice to rewatch the theatrical cut and get a sense of what was‚Ä¶  
8464  Full disclosure: I watched the 2020 recut called The Godfather Coda.¬†There is definitely a HUGE drop off in quality from the first two movies to this one, but it still is pretty good. While managing to be the shortest of the trilogy, this film suffered the most with pacing issues, especially towards the ending of the film.Also‚Ä¶Sofia Coppola. I know she is an immensely talented woman now, but she was definitely the weakest actor in this film, which‚Ä¶  
8465 Wrongfully hated, but rightfully scrutinized. Officially getting Andy Garcia season tickets. 
8466 I will tell you why it's bad, it doesn't have any rewatch value, have tons and tons of plot holes, og cast is gone, characters are boring, i hate the i love you cous incestuous subplot.I do know its merits, but i am biased and can't look at it separately without comparing it with other two parts of the anthology. I mean 1st part had Marlon Brandon, James Cann (one of my fav characters; Sonny), John Cazale. 2nd part had Robert, John. And 3rd part had Sofia Capoola. I mean it's self explanatory what i wanna say. (Al is the only good thing here)

8468 Underwhelming compared to the first two, but the ending was probably the most powerful scene from the entire trilogy. 
8469  Yes, I spent the weekend with the family! I want to start off to say, I hadn't seen the newer cut of this. the Death of Michael Corleone. This is the version I watched. It's been a long time since I watched the Godfather III so I couldn't really tell you any differences.With that said, I am not sure why it gets the hate it does. When you watch all of the Godfathers back-to-back, this one just slides right‚Ä¶  
8470 While it's galaxies away from the quality of 1 & 2, Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone AKA GFIII is quite good.Al Pacino's performance remains underrated while Sofia Coppola & the incest storyline remains ¬†..... ü´† 
8471 I didn‚Äôt really pay attention but it seemed kinda funny. Sofia Coppola is in it and she really sucks but everyone already thinks that. So: she‚Äôs awesome! Al Pacinos hair is straight up and gray. No Marlon Brando in sight. Why would Francis Coppola make this? College taught me: to make millions of money. So he could make bad movies that suck (balls). 
8472  Un ep√≠logo con m√°s marcada influencia de Dios, agarrado de antiguas escenas de The Godfather, con un protagonista cargado de culpa que necesita viajar a los or√≠genes terrenales de los Corleone para aliviar la violencia de Estados Unidos. Hay un Michael dudando el perd√≥n o la salvaci√≥n que implicar√° el retiro de la mafia, organizando negocios que justifican la cercan√≠a al Vaticano. La Iglesia tiene inter√©s rec√≠proco y se contagia de la muerte importada desde New York, como sucedi√≥ en‚Ä¶  
8473  A review of the re-edit ‚Äî The¬†Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone.¬†Like most people I sort of have mixed feelings, but as a whole I think this works pretty well. Michael trying to make a deal with the Vatican to secure his family‚Äôs future and disassociate himself from his previous businesses while seeking forgiveness for his past sins is genius, but its muddled plot, weaker dialogue, and wooden acting hurt the finished product ultimately making this the least‚Ä¶  
8474 I don't care what you guys think, this movie was awesome 
8475 C‚Äô√âTAIT UN BANGER AHHHHHHH non c‚Äôest trop incroyable les 3 films sont vraiment incroyable meilleur saga facile c‚Äôest du grand cin√©ma du grand art le d√©veloppement des perso surtout Michael et tout pendant les 3 est vraiment incroyable il est fort ce papy et Vincent c‚Äôest le seul Vincent que j‚Äôaime sur terre !!!!!! 
8476 The only thing I've learnt through watching these films is that the older and less hot Al Pacino gets, the worse the film is... 
8477 Tiene destellos pero es nefasta, innecesaria y casi todo eso que tiene el cine moderno, pero dej√©moslo en que es como drag√≥n ball GT (? Jajajaja bueno take it or leave it .

8479  The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael CorleoneThis one is obviously a step down from the first two, but I do feel it has some redeeming qualities. I liked the stuff between Michael and Kay and their children, and seeing how they feel about Michael. I didn‚Äôt mind the character of Vincent, but all the stuff about him being in love with his cousin is weird. The biggest problem with this one, I feel, is that it‚Äôs much less‚Ä¶  
8480  The Godfather Coda EditionI honestly don't have a lot to say about this film, it is definitely the weakest of the bunch. There's some great moments/performances here and a decent enough story but I didn't feel myself being too invested in anything in the grand scheme? A business deal, the Vatican, dealing with the life they left behind on the east coast, and dealing with a bunch of children becoming grown-ups.I applaud that this was made as a‚Ä¶

8485  Before proceeding with the review, knowing that this film exists in three cuts, this particular viewing was "The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone".Even before my first watch back in high school I was made aware of this films reputation as the black sheep of the trilogy. There's no doubt that Pt. III pales in comparison to its predecessors for a number of reasons, but I feel that for all of it's shortcomings that the surrounding perception regarding‚Ä¶

8487  how come ‚Äúi love you cuz‚Äù isn‚Äôt in the godfather quote books?¬†finally seeing the recut coda version and tbh i prefer the original ending, sorry coppola.¬†it‚Äôs been a long time since i‚Äôve seen this one, but i have to say this time around the lore of how weak it is compared to the other two really stuck out to me. the writing wasn‚Äôt as sharp, the story as strong and the acting was most of the time abismal.‚Ä¶  
8488  A lot of the runtime of The Godfather Part III, I spent pretty bored, as I found the storyline with Michael's involvement with Vatican Bank to be largely dull and uninteresting, and it took up too much of the runtime early on. There were also some bizarre choices with this film, like casting Sofia Coppola as Michael's daughter, as she gives a pretty poor performance despite being a pretty crucial character to the narrative. And the incest plotline that Michael's‚Ä¶  
8489  Wholly unnecessary and oddly incestuous? Not entirely irredeemable, but it feels like you can carve out a third of this runtime, improve the pacing, and still preserve everything of thematic importance. SO MUCH of the runtime drags with callbacks and recycled plot points. Meanwhile, the stuff specific to THIS plot is so quickly glossed over and becomes hard to follow. That whole opera sequence felt like it could‚Äôve resonated much better if I had a stronger grasp on everything going‚Ä¶  
8490 I know so much trivia about the behind-the-scenes, especially with the role of Mary Corleone, that it feels like a full circle moment that I‚Äôve finally watched it.

8494 Yes, very sad.Anyway, where's the oranges?I need more oranges. 
8495  ‚ÄúEnjoy the opera.‚ÄùIf Part I was Shakespeare, and Part II was Griffith meets Bertolucci, then this is Coppola‚Äôs most explicit‚Äîperhaps too explicit‚Äîcombination of De Palma (it could easily form a trilogy with Scarface and Carlito‚Äôs Way), Hitchcock (The Man Who Knew Too Much) or even Argento-meets-Kurosawa (Lucchesi‚Äôs death!) with Coppola‚Äôs Italian godfathers, i.e. Bertolucci and especially Visconti, from Rocco and The Leopard down to The Damned, Death in Venice, and Ludwig, all of which are constantly echoed either thematically‚Ä¶  
8496 Thematically great, wish execution was a lot better 
8497 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Compared to the other 2 films this movie is not very good but I managed to enjoy it in a way. Maybe if there was less incest and more mafia stuff then I would‚Äôve enjoyed it more. One of my other problems is the huge time jump, I don‚Äôt like how modern it was compared to the other films. Yet again though I loved the cinematography, and Michael is definitely one of my favourite movie protagonists now. Overall 8/10Next movie- Goodfellas üîú

8499 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Honestly? this film isn‚Äôt as bad as I thought it would be. I just wish that the movie was on the same level as the last hour of the film. If it weren‚Äôt for that last hour, the movie would‚Äôve been a disappointment to the trilogy.The acting in Mary‚Äôs death scene and how ultimately the trilogy ends with Michael dying alone made this movie go from 3.5 to 4 stars for me.It‚Äôs a very sad and bitter- not‚Ä¶   
8500 coda. still, was surprised that i got hooked enough that i didn't need multiple sittings like i thought. i'm positive others said this already but this appears to work better as the denouement to michael's story than a standalone film. and whatever my expectations were, sofia was okay. good on FFC and puzo to see through something much closer to their vision of this series' closer

8507 Well it's not great. 
8508  The preceding two films are perfect, this is far from perfect but still pretty good. While being the shortest film in the trilogy, it feels the longest. The pacing is slow. It‚Äôs not as interesting as the the other films.¬†There are some killer scenes though.

8509  [this will be my overall review/rating of the trilogy] first of all, i am aware of Francis Ford Coppola's impact to the film industry. similar to his work on The Godfather trilogy, they continue to be acclaimed by critics as among the best, if not the best, films of all time due of their excellent craftsmanship and compelling performances.while i agree with that, i couldn't get into the story to a great extent. i was even hesitant to watch‚Ä¶  
8510  Some people associate the mediocrity of this movie to not being on the same level as its two predecessors, to which i highly disagree.¬†This movie is mediocre on its own, and the fact that it serves as the conclusion of such a beloved trilogy brings it below that level.¬†For starters, Coppola originally didn‚Äôt even want to come back to the Corleone story and it definitely shows.¬†The plot is by far the weakest of the three, being much‚Ä¶

8517  I was worried this movie would be really bad but it was a lot better than I expected. Of course it was nowhere as great as the previous movies, but there were many scenes in this that I enjoyed.

8526  *Watched MARIO PUZO‚ÄôS THE GODFATHER, CODA: THE DEATH OF MICHAEL CORLEONE*It is quite baffling to me that this exists! It‚Äôs not even BAD, but it‚Äôs also not good. A lot of it is incomprehensible at times (the plot is completely ¬†convoluted and much of the stuff concerning the Vatican is nonsense) and Pacino, while still being a gifted actor circa 1990, just doesn‚Äôt have Michael Corleone in him any longer.

8529  I loved this film when I first watched it, now...not as much anymore.This is my least favorite out of all the three films because it just doesn't make sense to me. I think that the the Godfather II should've ended the story but Coppola still wrote a part 3 with a sub-story of an incest. That incest was just so annoying because 1.) it's so unnecessary to the film and 2.) it made it hard for me to focus‚Ä¶

8533 I know I‚Äôm in a minority but I have always liked this final part. It‚Äôs not perfect as the other two but I like the sadness that surrounds the story and it‚Äôs characters. First time watching the Coda version and the new version has really made the film even better. It wraps up the saga in a great way now. The opera scene at the end is so beautiful and powerful. This trilogy is a masterpiece.

8537 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   I am so diappointed‚Ä¶.The first two films in the franchise where very good and here I was wishing it was over. Everything was genuinely very boring up until the last half hour when Coppola paired music with assassination. I will definitely remember that as a classic moment in cinematic history.¬†The last ten minutes where also WONDERFUL. So much happening, very stimulating (unlike the rest). Mary dying was probably one of my favourite scenes in the entire franchise.¬†I‚Ä¶   
8538  C-C-C-COOOODAAAAI wasn't really noticing any huge departures from the Godfather 3 I know and, uh, know, and then Coppola hits you with the removal of the actual death of Michael Corleone, replacing it with a Sicilian saying/curse of how you may live a hunnet years. Oh no the hell that Michael is condemned to... living on a warm mediterranean estate with oranges and puppy dogs... Sofia's badness isn't exagerrated. She's so wooden! On the other hand, she's extremely attractive,‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs at times bloated, slow, and not quite as gripping as you may have come to expect, but I was mostly entertained by this!¬†Sofia Coppola should not‚Ä¶

Pero si, decae un mont√≥n a comparado de las otras dos, pero tiene cosas buenas esta. Siento que fue necesaria para darle un buen cierre a la trilog√≠a y tambi√©n al personaje de Michael. Sigue teniendo el mismo ambiente de la primeras dos, gracias a Francis Ford Coppola. Pero tiene sus fallas. La‚Ä¶  
8542 Honestly if it weren‚Äôt for Sofia Coppola‚Äôs character I think this one would be about as good as the others. I don‚Äôt even think it‚Äôs really her fault, it must have been really weird to have your dad direct you to be in an incestuous relationship with your cousin. Glad she got past this and entered her directing sicko mode. 
8543 Watchlist Clean Out Challenge 2022 Film 6by the end of this, i simply did not care! the script was mostly bad, so no one's performance was really great. i think it's pretty unfair that Sofia Coppola gets singled out when, like, most of those lines just don't work, especially without the right tone and set up. Pacino seems less like a grown older version of Michael Corleone and more like your standard Pacino Gangster Performance, with a lot of shouting. and I love some Pacino shouting---I just wanted something more from this. 
8544 It‚Äôs hard to top the first two films, which felt like two halves to a whole. It‚Äôs obvious that this was a tacked on finale that was both unnecessary and unwarranted. The absence of the Tom Hagen character had much more of an effect than I would‚Äôve expected. This movie finds its groove when Andy Garcia is on screen, but everything else? Eh. 
8545 infravalorada 
8546 What was once an elaborate and dense story filled with tragidy is now just another gangster flick with over-the-top dialogue, over-the-top writing, and just like nothing the two previous movies were like.Now, let me clarify, I don't think this movie is bad, I still enjoyed it, and if it was it's own thing, I don't think it would've gotten the backlash people give it, me included. But when you're the follow up and the conclusion to two of the greatest movies ever, this just ended up being a complete disappointment. 
8547 The incest bothered me and I‚Äôm a Star Wars fan

8549  And so ends the fabled tale of the Godmother, Connie Corleone Diane Keaton and Talia Shire CARRY this film, and are afforded even more lines this time! Wonderful! Al Pacino and Andy Garc√≠a ham it up so badly that it feels like a cheesy comedy at times, and Sofia Coppola is unfortunately as awful as everyone has already told you.Like Part 2 this employs the same visual style as the first. It manages to recapture some of the symbolism‚Ä¶  
8550  Coda: The Death of Michael CorleoneObviously it‚Äôs good, and the initial mixed reception is strange to look back on now. But I guess that the first two are so acclaimed that any drop in quality for a third entry will feel massive. But this is still definitely a good film.¬†It's much looser than the previous two, which makes sense as the focus is placed on the dissolution of Michael‚Äôs forces, and reflects how he feels lost in a‚Ä¶

8553 Mario Puzo's The Godfather Coda: "The Death of Michael Corleone" I always liked The Godfather Part III, but haven't seen it in 10 years. This cut seems to be the way to go if you're going to rewatch the trilogy. I thought, from what I can remember, this was a major upgrade and makes the film flow a lot better. Oh, and poor Sofia Coppola, she's doing her best!

( a lil obvious in its references )Very tired, going to watch videos of lumpy badgers and sleep bye bye 
8558 Still worth to watch.This sequel loses quite old school charms from the original one, but I oddly think it‚Äôs a good one. It has to be like this. I wish I had a chance to watch the pre-recut version. Idk I think this part feels too modern for me, but it‚Äôs also easier version to understand messages that the director was trying to convey.Anyway, Al Pacino‚Äôs acting skill was like a masterpiece. Man, it‚Äôs not him playing as Michael Corleone, it‚Äôs Michael playing the role of him. 
8559 absurdo 
8560 Truly about kissing cousins¬†‚ÄúHe‚Äôs your first cousin.‚Äù‚ÄúThen I love him first‚ÄùHonestly, I didn‚Äôt think Sofia Coppola was as bad as people say. Francis Ford Coppola has a ton of non-actors star in The Godfather trilogy. It‚Äôs kind of his thing. 
8561  "We can't do any worse than The Godfather 3" - Muppets Most Wanted. If The Godfather has a universally accepted reputation of "hey! that's a good movie!", The Godfather Part III's lasting legacy is "yeah this one's not so hot!" It's the go to punchline for an unnecessary sequel. (Godfather Part II is also unnecessary but at least it's got a neat structure) I went into this hoping to try and see if Part 3 is not quite as bad‚Ä¶  
8562  It‚Äôs tough to follow one masterpiece yet alone two. I‚Äôve heard so many bad things about the final film in this trilogy and to be honest I think they‚Äôre wrong. There‚Äôs some great stuff in here but I fully accept it isn‚Äôt the first two with regards to quality.¬†Pacino steals the show, filled with regret and remorse, seeking out to god to forgive his sins and repent.

Let‚Äôs get to the pros.Al Pacino is really good as Michael Corleone. But sometimes that isn‚Äôt the case. But in the scenes where he is really good. He‚Äôs really good.

8570 The Death of Michael Corleone also known as Death in certain cinematic circles, is flawed, but has a flawless final thirty minutes. 
8571  Unsurprisingly Godfather Part 3 is the one I have rewatched the least, despite having vivid memory of the preceding two masterpieces, I have no recollection or whatsoever regarding this last entry except a feeling of really digging it much. Thus watching the new cut is as fresh as watching it for the first time. Nevertheless, the viewing experience this time is surely not as bad as I ‚Äòremembered‚Äô. There‚Äôre still many problems present, the poor casting choice is one, others‚Ä¶  
8572 GIRL WHAT ???? the ending scene is so funny what did I just watch. Also Italians really caught a stray with this movie üò≠ the mafia is one thing but now they‚Äôre cousin fuckers too? 
8573  By Coppola's own admission, he was never particularly passionate about revisiting the world of THE GODFATHER. The making of the first film had been hell. But he was given carte blanche on PART II, and that turned out well for all concerned. Throughout the 80s, Paramount tried to get a third film going without Coppola, but these efforts proved fruitless. By the time Coppola agreed to come back, he faced some insurmountable hurdles and lacked the clout to get everything‚Ä¶  
8574  ‚ÄúThe Godfather part , CODA . The death of Michael Corleone.‚Äù is the final chapter in cinema‚Äôs greatest Mob movie franchise. Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo move the story into the 1970‚Äôs with the head of the Corleone family, Michael trying to become a respectable businessman.

Unfortunately his past won‚Äôt let go and‚Ä¶  
8575  The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone is a magnificent film, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. The cinematography by Gordon Willis, Production Design by Dean Tavoularis, and Costumes by Milena Canonero are all stunningly beautiful. The level of artistry could scarcely be higher. I'd also like to address Sofia Coppola's performance, which I feel has been unjustly criticized by film critics for over thirty years. Her portrayal of an ambitious young woman who longs for a love‚Ä¶  
8576  The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone Listen, it's not terrible, there's actually a lot of good in here the problem lies in it being a Godfather film because it barely feels like one. It works alright as a standalone piece about an aging mafia Don plagued with regret and guilt trying his hardest not to let history repeat itself and I think Coppola knew that considering the title of this director's cut. I think in terms of Pacino's‚Ä¶  
8577 So I finally caught The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone version of Coppola‚Äôs re-edit of The Godfather Part III,¬†and all I can muster to say about is that adds nothing, nor really detracts from the original cut. It merely exists as a very long, pointless epilogue to bookend Michael‚Äôs journey.¬†I don‚Äôt hate it, but I doubt I‚Äôll ever watch it again either. 
8578  At long last, I have finally seen Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone. I had wanted to see it in 2020, but this pesky Coronavirus made visiting the theater seem like too much of a gamble. By some luck, a local theater has been playing the trilogy every day including the updated version of the most notorious entry for $5. What a deal. Must have something to do with the recent 50th anniversary of the original. As one of the‚Ä¶

8582  Overall-6/10 this film is not that bad as people say it is but it is no where near close to the first 2 godfather films. If u know me my favorite movie is The Godfather.

8588 The best thing I can say about this movie is that its reception drove Sofia Coppola from acting to directing. 
8589 (coda) 
8590 Literally a 2.5 hour film about incest where no one mentions the word incest. 
8591  Note: This review is for the new director's cutI debated going to see the re release of Godfather 3 after seeing 1 and 2 but the completionist in me eventually won. I was also curious to see what this new cut of the film would be like since it's been at least 6-7 years since I last watched the 3rd film and I barely remember it so I thought it would be interesting to judge this alternate cut as‚Ä¶  
8592  Somewhere embedded in the various cuts of The Godfather Part 3 is a genuinely decent film, but has absolutely no potential of living up to the first two installments. Whilst The Godfather Coda slightly improves, the key issues are still ever so prevalent.A key issue with the film is that everything simply scratches the surface, certain plot lines feel irrelevant which takes potential time away from delving into the deeper stories. The Vatican storyline could have easily been explored‚Ä¶  
8593  I‚Äôm such an idiot for letting the bizarre critical consensus (that this is a bad film) put me off from watching it. I wouldn‚Äôt go as far as to call it a masterpiece as the other two parts are, though that description would certainly apply for the second half of the film.At first, I could see the difference. The script isn‚Äôt as tight, there is much less subtext and characters often have a line or two more than they‚Ä¶  
8594 The amount of brown worn by every character in this film is actually despicable. 
8595 Can we cut Garcia out next? 
8596 Ouch 
8597  *Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone at cinema*Well, slap my face and call me godfather, this is was a surprising treat.¬†The Godfather III was never considered an awful film, it was barely considered a bad film it was just seen as a 16-year late disappointment that couldn‚Äôt hold a Catholic candle to the other two. I have no idea what changes Francis Ford Coppola made in this director‚Äôs cut, but this is a worthy, fitting, satisfying closure to‚Ä¶  
8598 From the only riches in this world are children, to a silent shuddering wordless howl. Occasionally, the dark glasses come off and we look into Michael‚Äôs soul, then the dark lenses cover the eyes and emotion and thought are concealed. Thunder claps or church bells ring the omens for confession. Icons and crucifixes the setting for blasphemy. Just as the moment of victory and the beauty of re-found family beckon, the reckoning comes. 
8599  A much better film than I remembered and it‚Äôs reputation would have you believe. It‚Äôs a fitting end to the trilogy and about on par with part 2.¬†This version is a new edit redone for the films 30th anniversary and as far as I can tell the changes are subtle but maybe iron out a few of the original cuts issues.There‚Äôs a big jump in time from part 2 to this one and we pick up with a‚Ä¶

This time playing an ageing Michael Corleone, full of regret and worried about his legacy. Even after everything you‚Äôve seen the character do in the previous films, he still makes you sympathise and route for him.The‚Ä¶  
8602 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   To clarify, I have never seen the original theatrical edit of The Godfather Part III. There is some good with some bad here. The ending opera sequence is fantastic; it is really something that feels evocative of the previous two instalments of the Godfather franchise. Despite that high, it did not make me forget what had come before: a muddled, confused mess of a narrative. It is sad really to watch some points in this film, it‚Äôs a little bit‚Ä¶   
8603  Caught the Coda iteration in cinemas for the re-release. First time viewing of this film in any version ever. There‚Äôs baggage going in fresh with this one. When I first started reading around film as a teenager in the 00s this was still notorious as the definitive weak trilogy-capper, the failure against which other disappointing part 3s were compared. In its own way, that‚Äôs a sort of mystique. That sort of cultural priming you take with you into this has‚Ä¶  
8604 (The Coda Re-edit)The Godfather 3 is certainly a massive step down from the others but Y‚Äôknow what? I didn‚Äôt find is as bad as everyone described it beforehand (which was that it was the worst piece of shit to exist). There‚Äôs a lot that annoyed me; the acting was much, much worse (Sofia being the main culprit), there‚Äôs scenes where people look into the camera for 20 seconds and dead people breathing etc etc. but at the end of the day, I really like what they do with Michael and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs most important in a Godfather movie. 
8605  Watched the Godfather Coda death of Micheal Corleone cut of this.¬†I think this is honestly a good movie but oh my Jesus Christ Sofia Coppola is terrible in this, easily the worst acting I‚Äôve ever seen in a big budget movie. This could have been so much better if literally anyone else was playing Mary.This was a big step down from the previous two, which id say for sure are some of the best movies I‚Äôve ever seen,‚Ä¶  
8606 Not with a bang but with a whimper. 
8607  And seeing the trilogy in the cinema is complete. For me this and LOTR are a toss up for greatest trilogy of all time but don‚Äôt make me pick. First time seeing this new cut too admittedly it has been a bit since I have seen the original so I may not have picked up on some of the more subtle differences. As someone who never really had any issue with this movie anyway outside of the lack of Robert‚Ä¶  
8608  [THE GODFATHER CODA: THE DEATH OF MICHAEL CORLEONE cut]I understood the criticisms on how this felt 'unnecessary' but this film (the Coda cut, at least) is the consequences of Michael's sins. See the manifestations of one man's sins and how it easily takes over him and his loved ones that atoning is not an option. It also speaks to how Michael's Italian identity and family loyalty eventually gets preyed by American Capitalism and general greed, something I and II‚Ä¶

8611 Por favor, no es tan mala. Claro que Sofia Coppola no es la mejor actriz del universo, pero tampoco es que su actuaci√≥n sea tan mala como para condenar a toda la pel√≠cula.Es mas, creo que la parte III es mejor que la parte II, pero tal vez sea porque me agrada ver a Michael al fin intentar ser un buen humano de verdad tras volverse el Padrino, por lo que creo que hay un gran valor en la trama de la pel√≠cula. Pero, ¬øyo qu√© se? Soy s√≥lo un imb√©cil. 
8612 People are mad this movie didn‚Äôt reinvent filmmaking, can‚Äôt predicting the rise of Step-sibling porn be enough? 
8613  If you confess to your sins, they are still sins. It is pitiful the disrespect The Godfather Part III has received since its release. Yes, it is nowhere near as refined and significant as the first two in the series. But at the end of the day, The Godfather Part I & II are renowned as two of the greatest movies ever made! It would be damn near impossible to achieve the same level of mastery once again.I think The‚Ä¶  
8614 Finally made time to check out the The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corelone¬†and I am so glad that I did.¬†Coppola‚Äôs re-edit is a significant improvement on the original cut of The Godfather Part III, even if it can‚Äôt fix all the movie‚Äôs fatal flaws. This is paced so much better and it really makes a huge difference. 
8615  What happened, they put me in the room with Joe Zasa, what‚Äôs gonna happen, I bit the guy‚Äôs ear off.¬†Waffled a bit between 3 and 4 stars for me; ultimately the regret, weariness and heartbreak that Michael‚Äôs character portrays (setting aside Pacino‚Äôs moments of overindulgence) made me like the film more than I‚Äôd expected. Calling it a ‚Äúcoda‚Äù feels extremely correct. It serves as a continuation and a perhaps not-really-needed expansion of what was captured more artfully and thrillingly‚Ä¶

Two of the most monumental achievements in cinema.How could you follow that up? You can‚Äôt. So I will have to interrogate why Coppola decided to make this 3rd part.

8618 Where do I begin... First of all, i never expected that the problem with this film would be with acting but here we are. Did he really have to put his daughter in the movie? Like come on. That last scene where she was shot I laughed out loud when she fell to her knees, like what the fuck was that.Other than that, this movie had good closure, I mean I did feel for Michael at the end and I did hate Kay the whole time. She was Skylar White before Skylar White existed.

8620 The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael CorleoneIt's a TV movie sequel to among two of the most cinematic movies of all time... nothing about it even looks the same as Part I and II or feels like it's telling the same story... and while Al Pacino's performance has some merit, I often felt like he wasn't even playing the same character.Ultimately, it does nothing to add to the originals and really has very little reason to exist.

8625  It is not awful -- and I probably would have been more surprised if it was as awful as its been culturally mythologised. This was my first ever viewing, and it was of the new re-edit so I don't know how to accurately assess what is supposed to be better, worse, different, or exactly the same as the original version in any regard. For this version: it was fine. Frequently it felt very much like Godfather fan-fiction in form and‚Ä¶  
8626  And so wraps up the trilogy. I'm honestly a little surprised at the current rating, which as of the time of writing is 3.4. I've always heard negative things about this film and it also being the only film of the trilogy to not win Best Picture led me to believe this would be a stinker. I can see why there is some criticism for the film though. It's a little ironic that what I was hoping to see with‚Ä¶  
8627 Watched the Coda cut.Wow. Yeah. Wow.Only ever heard negative things about this film so to finally watch and witness something that, while not on par with the previous two, is still a masterclass in filmmaking and storytelling. Most likely the greatest trilogy ever put to film, maybe rivalled only slightly by The Lord of the Rings.¬†How people can talk about the greatest ever directors and not mention Coppola is beyond me.Wow. 
8628 I know a lot of people have their qualms with this film, but personally I love it. 
8629 Sure Sofia Coppola's acting was bland but everything else was amazing and just as good as the first two, unpopular opinion but hey.

8633  Decent enough film, even if it sometimes feels like the returning cast members aren't playing the same characters they played before. Having Michael show remorse for his past actions is a nice touch, but it's also a bit of a stretch given the events of the second film. Andy Garcia is a wonderful addition. All the stuff about The Vatican needing a bailout feels more relevant today than it did back then, and honestly, there's probably few large scale scams‚Ä¶

8636  Charlo and I spent the past few days watching The Godfather trilogy, ending with the recently re-edited and restored version of The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Micheal Corleone. The first two in the series is comfort food for my wife and I, so by default, are five stars all the way, hearts and all that mumbo-jumbo. The death of Apollonia has always gotten to me, only this time brought me to tears and fuckin fury. I wanted to take‚Ä¶

8639  In this episode of the show we are taking a look at Francis Ford Coppola's conclusion to The Godfather trilogy. Over the course of our discussion we examine the historical context of how this movie came about, we wonder what the recently re-edited Coda adds to the legacy of the series, we comment on the criticisms leveled at the film at the time of its release and - most of all - do our absolute best to examine the film‚Ä¶  
8640  Going from the first two Godfather films to the end of the trilogy is like going from savouring a fine wine to chugging Diet Coke.Score: 5/10Pros:+ Mostly solid performances, especially from Diane Keaton and Al Pacino.+ Great cinematography and editing, despite the lack of the deep contrast lighting in the last two films.+ Certain plot elements, like Michael reconnecting with Kay or Michael dealing with the loss of Fredo, either work well enough or could‚Ä¶  
8641 you know its worse than i thought. after the first 30 minute opening scene that was probably the most boring thing ive seen, i thought it was going to get better and it did for a while although it didnt really feel like a godfather movie. then boom incest plot line...like wtfending kind of redeemed it 
8642  Es realmente de una perfecci√≥n inobjetable, obras maestras si las hay, es incre√≠ble como el gui√≥n est√° escrito sim√©tricamente con las dos anteriores sin dejar de contar algo nuevo y dar un cierre a la saga, a todos y cada uno de los personajes y a cada uno de los dilemas morales que plantea la misma. No le sobra un plano ni una l√≠nea de di√°logo, es ins√≥lita la cr√≠tica que la bastardea tanto por las actuaciones de Sof√≠a Coppola‚Ä¶  
8643 Bumm okay. definitely not a bad movie, but one that has a lot of moments that made me go ¬†‚Äúwhy?‚Äù¬†and ‚Äúokay‚Ä¶‚Äù. namely the incest plotline (sofia coppola‚Äôs performance doesn‚Äôt help either). III is¬†missing the wit of its predecessors with a lot of drama feeling fabricated for the sakes of drama itself. though when it soars, it really soars. some moments and conversations are as fantastic as ever, and it‚Äôs still a Godfather movie. it is a good film, just nowhere near the previous two, especially with that ultra jarring final scene. 
8644 Much more streamlined than the first two, I guess and definitely not up to those masterpieces. What works best is viewing it as an epilogue for a very long epic story. So there's a lot of good things, though it still has it's problems.Still, I like the history connected to the story - the Vatican's corruption in particular. It seems to be the curse of threequels, with the exception of The Lord of the Rings, that the third doesn't quite reach where the others went before. That's okay, it's good to have an actually good third Godfather movie now. 
8645 Granted I had watched parts I and II and shunned part III after them leaving me lukewarm to the series some 25 years ago I watched all parts ending with the director's cut of part III in one fell swoop and, well, this holds together as a solid, fascinating, at times boring but most of all impressive trilogy. 
8646 Godfather 2 and 3? More like a Coppola hours of my life wasted 
8647 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Notice how both Don Vito and Michael die a natural death. The one, in his flourishing garden, playing with his grandson (symbolic for the future) and the other dying alone on a stony property, spending his last minutes with thinking about his past. That's the difference between them. Don Vito knew the values of life  
8648 If you're going to watch The Godfather: Part III, don't. Instead, watch The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone. The film has been re-edited to a much smoother experience compared to Part: III, and the beginning and end has been redone to a higher caliber to make Part: III the best it possibly could be with what material we've received.Vanilla: 6/10Coda: 7/10

8650 i think i would like this more if every character didn‚Äôt look exactly the same, to the point in which i would think that a character was dead and then his lookalike would appear in the next scene 
8651 The most 90s looking film supposedly set in the 70s? Andy Garcia is so very annoying. This whole film just feels unnecessary. It might be worth it for the "I thought I was out" line. But there are just so many many cringeworthy moments. When I was done with this film, there was an hour left of the runtime. "It never ends". I feel ya Diane Keaton, I feel ya. Adding half a star to my rating because I really want to see that opera now. PS: George Michael and Maeby should have watched this together in an Arrested Development episode, what a missed opportunity.

8654 Ich bin positiv √ºberrascht. Kann zwar mit den ersten beiden Teilen nicht mithalten, ist aber insgesamt trotzdem ein ziemlich guter Film. Vor allem die letzten 15 Minuten machen den dritten Teil sehenswert und sind meiner Meinung nach ein w√ºrdiges Ende der Trilogie.

8665 La tercera parte, a pesar de no ser tan brillante como sus predecesoras, comparte ese estilo, tono y categor√≠a.¬†No es una maravilla, pero no por ello es una mala pel√≠cula.Siento que hay partes del guion bastante atropelladas y que no casan bien, haciendo que se pierda un poco el hilo narrativo del film.A pesar de ello, es una gran pel√≠cula que, con este remontaje, ayuda a dar un final m√°s bonito, decente y po√©tico a Michael Corleone y a la saga de El Padrino. 
8666 En af de dage, hvor man fuldst√¶ndig ignorerer, at man faktisk har nogle ting, man burde g√∏re og i stedet bruger 9 timer p√• at se hele Godfather-trilogien. Og det var s√• godt! 
8667 The Coda version starts better, but I honestly prefer the original ending of the saga. The first two films are obviously on another league, but this one has its own nostalgic appeal and a bunch of impressive scenes. I really really like it overall, but its screenplay quite often seems like a subpar copy of the first Godfather. And Sofia Coppola‚Äôs casting was A Choice and her ‚Äúperformance‚Äù a stain to the general quality of the trilogy. 
8668 I love the smell of incest üòçüòçüòç 
8669 I feel like this movie would be much more well-liked if the newer cast members were better at acting, but I still enjoyed it. Not nearly as good as the first two, but I can forgive that, as this feels more like an epilogue to them rather than a whole new chapter. 
8670 Somewhere between The Cotton Club and Youth Without Youth, obfuscates narrative/characters/performance, serving pure spectacle and a sustained aching emotion. Entirely worth it also for Shire/Pacino/Keaton who are the only real presences in the movie. ‚ÄúWhat do you want from me Michael?‚Äù

8678 how this one sits amongst the others? yeah, I get it now.but also I want to be be sure to not single out Sofia's performance as a focal point. A lot more goes sideways from a story perspective before this!

8682 just because it‚Äôs not that bad doesn‚Äôt make it good 
8683  Considering all the negativity that surrounds this film like a bad aura I was expecting something truly appalling but instead I got something that whilst being incredibly flawed isn‚Äôt appallingly¬†bad.¬†The two main issues with the movie is the incest subplot and Sofia Coppolas acting. I don‚Äôt know what Francis Ford Coppola was going through in his head to not only put his own daughter in a main role in his film but have her take part in an incest‚Ä¶

8685  76An interesting reflection on themes handled better in the first two films, but it is not bad by any means; Coppola (Sofia, that is) and Garcia are dare I say good, but it‚Äôs hard to match the excellence of the first two films without the cast and characters that made the first two classics. That is often due to the story - Fredo and Sonny‚Äôs (John Cazale and James Caan) deaths - but it is moreover due to the‚Ä¶  
8686 Don‚Äôt know where the acting wentPacino and second half hard carry 
8687  I watched the original version on DVD in middle school following the first two and was very disappointed. I haven‚Äôt seen it since.This is largely the same movie but even though the edits are slight, I think they turn this movie from something that I didn‚Äôt enjoy watching to something I still wouldn‚Äôt really recommend but did at least enjoy watching. Moving a key scene to the beginning instead of 40 minutes in makes the structure of the movie‚Ä¶  
8688 While the re-edit is a liked change the problems with the acting, pacing, and poor story choices still hold this movie back. It‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt mesh well with the other films in the series and has a strange focus on new characters for what really should be a character study of Michael. Also, I hate how no one is grossed out by the romance between two cousins it totally takes me out of the film. 
8689 i went into this with an open mind but it deeply offended every cell in my body. unforgivable. 
8690 ‚ÄúJust when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!‚Äù 
8691 I think this may be da saddest feature I have ever seen. Da death of da life. Micheal Corleone, da last real mobster standing begins to sit... and then he falls. 
8692 Contrary to Coppola's introduction, The Godfather Coda is not a "different film", but it is a better film. The edits are subtle, but noticeable and the final result is satisfying. The heft of the film comes from Michael's quest for redemption and, thus far, this is why this series remains the gold standard in mob epics. Remember. There's always a bigger mob above the mob. And it always seems to extend to highest echelons of the Catholic Church and the corporate state. 
8693  Esse filme tem problemas serissimos, seja o subplot de incesto ou o substituto fraco comparado ao Michael, foi o filme que eu menos gostei, mas ao mesmo tempo ele tem suas qualidades e trabalha bem os temas principais da trilogia e o que ela se trata no final Michael encara a consequ√™ncias da vida que ele escolheu todo o bem e mal que ele fez no final conduziram quem ele √© e a jornada dele e o final dele n√£o‚Ä¶

I have the entire trilogy on Blu Ray, so I figured this didn't need to go to waste on my shelf.Anyway, it's... good? All things considered? Normally, I give 7/10 ratings to movies that I like, but don't love.

All the assasination scenes were really dope, Andy Garcia was a nice addition to the family, and all the nostalgia-based references and talk of previous events I thought worked well for the last of the trilogy.

8709 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Still pretty good in this new version entitled "The Godfather: Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone", even though I don't think too much has changed from the original. I was more interested in the Vatican stuff this time around, but it's still too convoluted to follow all the pieces. Pacino definitely does too much at times like his diabetic stroke, but he mostly does a solid job here. The ending used here is probably a better choice than the original‚Ä¶   
8710 Li don't care what most people say, the godfayher part III is just as good as the other two movies. 
8711 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Before watching this third part of the Godfather, I was quite unsure what to expect from it, since the reviews aren‚Äôt overwhelming and the consensus is that it isn‚Äòt as good as the first two movies.¬†After watching it I must say it‚Äòs not a masterclass film but still a good movie. Pacinos performance of this older Michael Corleone is brilliant. The music and the image of the film are very well on the same level as the first two‚Ä¶   
8712 Apparently I saw the new cut that came out in 2020 either way this is really average and doesn't come close to the first two it's not as bad as I thought it would be. Sofia Coppola is pretty terrible but I'm glad she found her voice as a director, overall a pretty average movie with a pretty bad performance you don't really have to watch it but if you want to complete the trilogy go for it. 
8713 sofia coppola should stick to directing 
8714 Muito pelo contr√°rio do que muitos pensam, eu n√£o vejo isso como um filme que destr√≥i a trilogia dada como perfeita. Mas pense bem: se voc√™ fosse Francis Ford Coppola, um homem que fez pelo menos 3 dos maiores filmes de todos os tempos, como voc√™ encerraria uma trilogia se n√£o com o Al Pacino chorando em escadas de uma maneira 100% ic√¥nica?! Mais uma vez, digo que falar mal disso √© vitup√©rio. 
8715 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  al pacino really died at the end of this movie of chronic boredom  
8716  It‚Äôs not as bad as some people make it out to be. Sure, there are quite a few under-developed characters and Sofia Coppola attempts acting, but it‚Äôs still an alright film. There are many worse ways to end a trilogy, such as Star Wars:¬†The Rise of Skywalker and The Hobbit:¬†The Battle of the Five Armies, so the fact that it doesn‚Äôt sink as low as those two abominations is a blessing really. I think the main problem is how different‚Ä¶  
8717 The Dramatic Finale to this legendary Trilogy. It may not be on the masterpiece level of the first two movies but nonetheless a great movie and a must watch if you liked the first two movies. 
8718 The film is as epic in scope, scale, and presentation as its predecessors, yet I think it falls a bit short when it comes to the plot and characters. It's basically a greatest hits album of the previous films. If you liked Godfather 1 and 2, I don't see why you wouldn't enjoy this one. I saw the Coda/Director's Cut, but never saw the original so can't compare them. 
8719 I went into this movie with low expectations and somehow it still disappointed me 
8720  This is for The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone, I have never seen the original cut of Godfather Part 3 so it's quite a unique experience to get to watch the entire trilogy for the first time with this new cut for part 3 and damn it's not perfect but you can't deny its very powerful. The plot is admittedly a bit convoluted and confusing at times and Sofia Coppola... now I understand everyone's problems, she drags every‚Ä¶  
8721 Finally finished the Godfather trilogy, it's inexplicably taken me twenty years to watch the final chapter!It's a very well made film that never feels it's length and the standout moments are superb but it doesn't always feel like a Godfather film, the more overblown moments (whilst undoubtedly entertaining) feel at odds with the tone and pace of the first two parts.Niggles aside I really enjoyed it although it's the weakest of the trilogy it's still a good film.

8725 Think I checked how long was left like 10 times and it was always too long 
8726  This was a good movie. Definitely a good ways above average. But it lacked the eloquence and subtleties of the previous two installments. Alot of stuff in here was pretty silly. It was weird hearing swearing. Don vito didnt swear. Over all the most italian movie of the series. A good bit of the plot was lost on me. The pope was doing something? The pope bank was up to something? Michael is doin stuff? The other mafia peoples is‚Ä¶  
8727 Al Pacino was so good I cannot ever see myself hating this film. 
8728  This new version does feel like a tighter, more nuanced and narratively clearer film, but it doesn‚Äôt really solve any of the problems of the initial version that stop it from being as much of a classic as the preceding two - the tone is still hysterical, the plot is still convoluted and Sofia Coppola still isn‚Äôt as engaging as the character requires.What it does do very successfully, however, is reduce the pressure on the film to be a‚Ä¶  
8729  As a filmgoer, I have never really found myself hating unnecessary sequels or remakes. Some are actually really good. But there has to be some semblance of a point to their existence.

It‚Äôs a spiritual longing that goes back for millennia. We want absolution for our wrongdoings, and we‚Ä¶  
8730 This was disappointing. The plot was very hard to follow and unnecessarily complicated. Pacino is not bad but he isn‚Äôt giving anywhere near the performance he did in the first two films. And Sofia Coppola was terrible (side note: she is one hell of a director though).I suspect if I had seen this as a stand-alone film, I would still have given it the same rating but I would have liked it more. But it‚Äôs very much a part of a series so ... yeah, disappointed. 
8731 if you say it doesn't exist it doesn't exist :) 
8732  I saw this in the theater when it came out and Bill Murray was still "just" the guy who owned Caddyshack whenever he was on screen.I went into this revisit with an open mind... but nope.She's a very good director. Is she the world's worst actress or example of the most egregious Hollywood nepotism ever? Hardly and, close but not quite.Her time onscreen is cinematic quicksand that no amount of editorial choosing of the best wooden line‚Ä¶  
8733 Not as good as the first two but almost entirely justified by a few scenes, most notably the opera scene. The hate this film gets is pretty ludicrous imo. 
8734 The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael CorleoneJust when I thought I was out, they make a recut and pull me back in! 
8735 Codachrome 
8736 Finally got around to this one. Unnecessary but not as bad as I was previously led to believe. Why were Bridget Fonda and John Savage in this again? 
8737 I don‚Äôt remember the original cut well enough to see the differences. I love Francis Ford Coppola. If I could go back in time, I‚Äôd try to get a job at the American Zoetrope studio while it briefly existed. I would love to know the man. Still, this movie is kind of slow, doesn‚Äôt feel particularly like a period film, and just doesn‚Äôt come close to living up to the prior films.

8740 i‚Äôm only halfway through so far but WHY IS THERE AN INCEST STORYLINE AND WHY DID NO ONE PREPARE ME FOR THIS 
8741  This movie is nowhere near as bad as I've been led to expect it to be. Still nowhere near as good as the first two, but that's not all that surprising. There are pieces of a great movie here, and a lot of it works really well. I mean come on, you've got a legendary filmmaker working with some incredible actors, fantastic production design and Mario Puzo himself is back as co-screenwriter. It is not a bad movie in any‚Ä¶  
8742 Gotta say this as blasphemous as it is. This is my favorite Godfather movie. It says fuck the glamour and suspense of the mob life. Here is what its like when you seen it all, cause you've been it all. Long gone are the days of first god father and good fellas. That childlike wonder and awe of this new life and what it could hold. No now we know that this life cost everything and this is what we're left with. 
8743 How did anyone involved with this film believe that a love story between first cousins is something anyone could get behind? WTF? Joey Za Za sucks as a villain and why the heck would Michael give his business away to a hothead who repeatedly makes terrible decisions? Skip this one. 
8744 Whenever Joey Zasa speaks all I can hear is Fat Tony 
8745 Coda Version! Really made a difference. Much more fluid and focused. 
8746 83/100How anti-climatic is the character of Sofia Coppola so flat, you se Diane Keaton, Al Pacino and Andy Garcia and later see Sofia and pfff...Sofia is wonderful like director but in front of the camera is terrible.The best on the film are the performances of Pacino, Diane and Andy Garcia.Gordon Willis not so inspired in the cinematography except in the third act.Not is a bad movie, the problem with The Godfather Part III is: The Godfather and The Godfather II. 
8747 So the majority of this movie was lacking very severely compared to the other two movies. It feels so much different in something which I just can‚Äôt seem to put my finger on. However whatever this movie was lacking it made up for in that brilliant last scene.

8756  What an absolute disappointment.That's not to say that the film is devoid of any redeeming qualities at all because that's not true. The final thirty minutes are phenomenal and Pacino and Garcia both have moments of great acting within. Some lines of dialogue have stuck with me through to the film's finale. The confession scene is also so satisfying.Despite these, the film is bogged down by forced storylines just to simply make another film to close out the‚Ä¶

8760  There is a lot to still love here, the direction is still absolutely flawless, and so is much of the acting but for most of the runtime, the story was bland and incredibly inconsistent. It is never inherently bad but watching the dramatic decline in quality from the beyond superior first and second entry, just worsens the blow of disappointment.

8761  [DISCLAIMER: This is a review of The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone]Ahem,I‚Äôll start off by saying that at first I totally got all the hate that Sofia Coppola has gotten over the years for her role, she cannot act and the whole cousin-fucking subplot is weird.

8763 CAN NEVER GO WRONG WITH AN OPERA SEQUENCE, SO AGAIN: INVIGORATING 
8764  While I've rewatched the whole of 1&2 many times, and even more sequences since I first saw them, I couldn't even remember when I first watched Part 3, let alone the machinations of the plots.To finish the trilogy with our teens, this was the original cut from our DVD set, not the new version. It's nowhere near the level of the two earlier films but, to be honest, there's not much in the whole of cinema that is. This‚Ä¶  
8765 Not that bad but not nearly as intriguing as the first two. 
8766  The Godfather Part III¬†is one of a huge number of second sequel/climactic installments of a franchise that have an awful reputation. Part of this was somewhat encouraged by co-writer/director Francis Ford Coppola himself‚Äîafter The Godfather Part II, the filmmaker considered the story of Michael Corleone finished, as the character seemingly had nothing left to gain or lose. Paramount pictures was hellbent on continuing to milk the IP, commissioning several sequel scripts that merely put the Corleone‚Äôs (led by a young‚Ä¶  
8767 It might be the Coda cut but it‚Äôs still The Godfather Part III. 
8768 Watched The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone. Not too many substantial differences, but it was marginally better and more tightly paced than the original Godfather Part 3. Definitely the way to go if you ever plan to watch the full trilogy. 
8769 {Coda edit}It‚Äôs been decades since I‚Äôve seen the other cut, but this played with much more dramatic force than I remember it having (I notice that it‚Äôs now shorter). It‚Äôs certainly a more direct film than Part II. As a story about trying to define one‚Äôs legacy through a group of disappointing heirs it achieves operatic dimensions even before its conclusion. They probably should have paid Duvall what he wanted, though. 
8770 This review is for the: Mario Puzo‚Äôs The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone. ¬†This coda is done right. Bravo. Not only Sofia Coppola was stunning but she was perfect for the role. What a way to end this ride. 
8771  üëçüçÖ68% || GRADE: CThe Godfather Part III is an interesting ending to one of cinema‚Äôs best and cherished trilogies of all time. But it‚Äôs messy sub-plots, confusing side stories and overall needing didn‚Äôt leave me with the satisfaction that I wanted.¬†I really don‚Äôt know what to say about this film. It had all the makings of a solid ending and instead I was left with this messy film that really didn‚Äôt feel like a solid ending for me.‚Ä¶  
8772 I enjoyed the third film but I see why it‚Äôs the least favourite of the trilogy. Some moments seemed too rushed and skimmed over. However, it was so interesting to see the character development of Michael Corleone from a harmless, academic war veteran to ruthless mafia leader over the 3 films. Al Pacino‚Äô s performance was stellar. 
8773 Watched the Coda. This feels like a series of events that happen to occur, with a larger narrative not quite there. My favourite moment was the mobster exclaiming about his lucky coat. 
8774  Mario Puza‚Äôs The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone‚ÄúDon Corleone, I need your help.‚ÄùThe first big change (and one of the two biggest changes) to Coda is repositioning the scene in which the Vatican comes to Michael.¬†This is a good choice. Generally, it‚Äôs a bad idea for your inciting event to arrive forty minutes into a film.Obviously, the original cut was full of homages and references to the earlier films.¬†Indeed, one of the smarter aspects of‚Ä¶  
8775  As big a devotee of the Godfather films as I am (my love runs marrow-deep), this is only my second viewing ever of its final installment, in part a preparation before I watch the newly released coda/redux/whatever. I still stand by the notion that the spine of this movie, focused on an aging mobster trying and failing to go legitimate by tangling with the impenetrable corruption of the Catholic Church, would've made for a fine narrative had Coppola created original‚Ä¶  
8776  It's quite amazing to finally see The Godfather Part III after thirteen years of putting it off- 2007 being the first time that I'd ever seen the two greatest films of all time- and to feel virtually nothing about it. My own seething rage accompanied every passing moment, sure, but I suspect that it really will be easy to forget that this pointless money grab ever even happened. There are some things that work (Pacino's surprisingly docile performance, Diane Keaton's‚Ä¶  
8777 Godfather 3 is a 3 and a half star movie, burdened by the 2 masterpieces that came before it. 
8778 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Hilarious they cut the death of Michael Corleone from the cut called The Death of Michael Corleone  
8779 Nepotism, man. The role of Mary could have been GREAT. 
8780 The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone¬†has a clunky new title but that‚Äôs just about the biggest difference in what is functionally the same movie as the theatrical release, and just like the theatrical release, it is merely fine. 
8781  When we last encountered Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) in Francis Ford Coppola‚Äôs second Godfather picture, he‚Äôd coldly reasoned away the last parts of his soul, emotionally imprisoning his long-suffering wife Kay (Diane Keaton) and then ordering the death of his weak, sweet brother Fredo (John Cazale). The last seconds of that 1974 classic feel definitive in terms of how they close Michael‚Äôs arc: he‚Äôs sitting in the woods, visibly aged and ‚Äì if not for the small cadre of bodyguards‚Ä¶  
8782 The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael CorleoneFundamentally the same film, which is to say already very good. 
8783  Alright, is this as good as the previous two iterations of The Godfather? No, of course not. Is this a bad film, though? Well, that's a bit more complicated. There is some good to be found here. I think Al Pacino and Diane Keaton, returning in their roles as Michael and Kay, respectively, are both good. Keaton's material in terms of dialogue is god-awful, but she does a good job with it (especially in the second half of the film)‚Ä¶  
8784  The Godfather Coda: Death of Michael Should be ¬†like Special editions of Star Wars, were it‚Äôs the official cut of the film and the other cut no longer exists and are hard to findUnlike The special editions of Star Wars, this actually improves the film not ruins it. That being said it‚Äôs still not as good and is overall a disappointment. It‚Äôs a lot more boring and less focused as the other two.¬†I do wish he cut a‚Ä¶  
8785 Of course The Godfather Coda is the weakest entry in Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola's beloved trilogy, but that's because of how it compares to its masterpiece predecessors. On its own merits, the third installment is actually a solid film. Sofia Coppola and Talia Shire deliver awkward performances and the film itself is a lot slower-paced but the third act at the opera more than makes up for these shortcomings. Although The Godfather Part III is far from a masterpiece, it is a fine conclusion, especially due to the performances of Al Pacino and Andy Garcia. 
8786 The Godfather CODA The Death of Michael Corleone is a Good Movie and I would recommend this movie to someone. 
8787 i cried... 
8788  For a unique (edit: apparently not so unique) experience, I watched the Coda cut without having seen the original (and some years since I last saw the first two). It‚Äôs not that bad!!Well, okay. Sofia¬†is that bad, but there‚Äôs not exactly a ton of her. Where the story goes thematically makes sense, even if the details get a little jumbled towards the end.

8791  This is a mess of a film. Living up to the first two films is already bad enough but this film just didn‚Äôt even seem to try. Godfather III feels like a pale imitation of the first two films that takes some interesting narrative choices like Michael‚Äôs road to redemption but also takes very questionable narrative choices like the romance subplot between Vincent and Mary. The movie is a disjointed mess. When I wasn‚Äôt weirded out by the plot, I‚Ä¶  
8792  We watched the new Coda edition or whatever the hell they‚Äôre calling it. You know, the one with the FFC hostage tape at the beginning. It is definitely an improvement over the old cut.

Somehow Garcia is also hammy as hell but way more fun than those two - he‚Äôs the best part of‚Ä¶  
8793  Mario Puzo's The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael CorleoneCan't really disagree with the changes that Coppola has made in 2020 to reposition this film vis-a-vis his two earlier masterpieces (with the exception of the end title card, which superfluously functions like the rat at the end of THE DEPARTED).

8794  The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael CorleoneI really wish Paramount let FFC name this the title he wanted.

8797 This a review for CODA.I've never seen 3. I always heard so many bad things. I had to check out CODA because it was the "definitive" better version. That may be all marketing but I enjoyed it. Not perfect but it felt like the closing of the Godfather book.Although, I NEED AN ANDY GARCIA GODFATHER 4. 
8798 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   There's one moment in The Godfather III that I think truly works, almost to the level of the original two. The movie fumbles its dramatic climax with Mary's death, but the aftermath ‚Äì Michael's silent scream of agony ‚Äì is as skilled a piece of filmmaking as Coppola has ever created. Pacino opens his mouth wide as the sound drops and in that moment he looks hollowed out by anger, by grief, by the sin of killing his father's son‚Ä¶   
8799  Saw The Godfather Coda, and while I don‚Äôt know how different it is compared to the original cut, I can‚Äôt imagine either version being as bad as the word-of-mouth I heard beforehand. I hear this cited often as one of the most disappointing sequels of all-time, and while it can‚Äôt measure up to the first two, it definitely had impressive moments and a nail-biting heartbreaking finale.I can imagine it being a really underwhelming follow-up after a 16 year gap,‚Ä¶

8802  [...] Kultregisseur Francis Ford Coppola nahm sich nach 30 Jahren sein Sorgenkind Der Pate 3 vor, um seine urspr√ºngliche Vorstellung des Films doch noch umzusetzen. Heraus kommt mit Der Pate Epilog ein Kriminalfilm, der immer noch mit den Geistern der Vergangenheit zu k√§mpfen hat: Durchwachsene Handlungsstr√§nge und teils uninspiriertes Schauspiel mischen sich unter ikonische Filmmomente wie in der Oper, die an die glorreichen Tage der Pate-Trilogie erinnern.

8803 Coda version. Slightly better. Still wish they could have had Michael die on the steps of the Opera theater. 
8804  so im just gonna be upfront here and say I think this new edit is janky and kind of bad. the first half is cut to ribbons in a way that kills the pacing and suffocates the mood. opening up top w the plot is fine but all the establishing shots are cut so we never know where we are. it seems like things have been nip/tucked for no purpose so there's lots of awkward fade outs and scenes that‚Ä¶  
8805  For decades I feel like I've heard nothing but trash talk in regards to The Godfather: Part III.¬†I, myself had personally made a conscious effort to avoid it until today, and as I finally did just now sit through its near 3-hour duration, I found myself simply waiting for the stink to kick in.

8807 Sofia Coppola is an excellent director.

8812 si quitas el incesto es buena pel√≠cula 
8813 Don't remember a ton about the original, but I quite liked this cut. Still glad Sofia turned to directing. 
8814 Frankie was smart in keeping the three big sequences from the original cut intact and giving the whole thing a faster feeling while greatly improving Sophia's performance. I still think I prefer the original cut over this which does feel more like a sequel where this has the tone of an epilogue. I understand that's what Frankie was going for, but give me the slower loss of control that the original cut has.[Mario Puzo‚Äôs The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone] 
8815  This film presented a unique viewing opportunity for me. Part of a franchise of ‚Äúessential‚Äù viewing material, almost universally decried upon initial release, and re-cut to mixed reviews, almost all written by those who had already seen the original.¬†If The Godfather parts I and II are Kanye West‚Äôs first 3 albums, this film is 808s and Heartbreak. Coppola fucked with the formula. Obviously imperfect and much less consistent than its predecessors, Coda nevertheless impressed me, and made a markedly‚Ä¶  
8816  So a conspiracy involving the Vatican wasn‚Äôt where I expected the Godfather saga to go...and the incest romance that‚Äôs integral to the plot was a choice...and Sophia Coppola‚Äôs wooden acting would make an oak tree blush.But you know what? This movie is actually really really great! That montage juxtaposing the opera with the mafiosi violence towards the end is pure cinema! ¬†Al Pacino is great here as Michael Corleone but I still wish shouty Al Pacino hadn‚Äôt murdered‚Ä¶  
8817  This entry is for Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone alternate cut.So, this is an improvement. Definitely not an overhaul, Coda contains little edits and changes that slim down the movie by five minutes, but it ends up feeling much brisker than before, which is great. Sofia Coppola still is, well, Sofia Coppola, but her *spoiler* final death scene has been reworked, and is now much less cringey. The reworked edit actually makes a lot of the plot much‚Ä¶  
8818  This seemed like the only route for Michael to go. I for one hated the ending of Godfather 2.

8823 I recently saw the Directors Cut version of The Godfather Part III - with some strange idea that it might rescue this film. In the end it suffers from the Jar Jar Binks syndrome. She would later become a talented Director in her own right - but, unfortunately, Sofia Coppola's turn at acting took every scene she is in down - not to mention the strange incest nature of her character's relationship to her first cousin - cast by her own father no less. The only reason I would see this again is a version where her character is edited out. 
8824  Thoughts on the "Coda" cut (2020):Here's the thing with Francis Ford Coppola: He's one of the 10 or 20 most gifted people who has ever done this job, so even when he makes a B-minus movie like The Godfather Part III, there are still a lot of good courses in the meal. And even the things that absolutely do not work, with distance and the right perspective, become kind of fascinating for their wrongness. I haven't sat and watched‚Ä¶  
8825  Watched The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael CorleoneThe blu-ray for The Godfather Coda states it as the definitive new edit of Part III. And for Francis Ford Coppola it might very well be. There are 3 things of note I felt it did well. First it jump starts the plot of the film right from the start. In the original edit it takes over 30 minutes for that to occur. Another is the edit manages to turn Sofia‚Ä¶  
8826  Just when i thought i was out, they pull me back in.....The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone is a new edit from Francis Ford Coppola this edit cuts out a good chunk of 20 minutes from the theatrical cut, some scenes have also been moved and the movie has a completely new opening and ending, there were also some new musical cues added.

8827 It‚Äôs still shit, but less shittier than the 1990 release 
8828  This was my least favorite part of The Godfather trilogy however it was the perfect ending nonetheless. An extremely well directed movie by Francis Ford Copolla and I felt that this encapsulated what it‚Äôs like to be a Corleone very well. Michael got screwed over by Lucchesi, Gilday, and Keinszig with the Immobiliare deal but he still managed to have all three of them killed and ended up landing the deal with Lamberto before he was killed. Speaking of which,‚Ä¶  
8829  8.5/10This review is about the 2020 Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone re-cut. It's always interesting seeing changes made by a director often years later and usually they just try to change stuff up tahta lot of people loved about the film like George Lucas did with Star Wars. But Francis Ford Coppola already did a Final Cut with Apocalypse Now that, in my opinion, heavily improved on the Redux and theatrical cut and here it is no different.‚Ä¶  
8830  Creo que lo que m√°s se puede destacar de la trilog√≠a es que Coppola fue lo menos oportunista posible, en las 2 secuelas de la original nunca intent√≥ imitarlas, al contrario, busc√≥ diferenciar a cada una, que fueran lo m√°s independientes posibles entre s√≠, aunque obvio tratando con los mismos personajes, por lo menos los que quedaban vivos, jaEn esta tiene un doble desaf√≠o, diferenciar pero a la vez aunar las 3, es la conclusi√≥n, el cierre, el final‚Ä¶  
8831  Coda edition:Starts out feeling like a soap opera whose main characters are a set of non-descript accent lamps placed around set. Once you see them, you'll know what I'm talking about. Characters pop in and out of scene like they would in a soap, and they're all shot in medium to wide shots that give it a very generic, almost made-for-tv feel. Once we get into the meat of the plot it gets better. Andy Garcia's journey from neo-Sonny‚Ä¶  
8832 coda cut 
8833  I never had a problem as great as many with The Godfather III, but even still only watched it once. Perhaps it was the giveover to all the new young characters, perhaps the absence of others, perhaps simply because it followed two of the greatest films of all time. Godfather III‚Äôs theatrical cut was a perfectly serviceable mafia film, better than many, not as bad as most said. Watching The Godfather III‚Äôs redux into Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone,‚Ä¶  
8834  The Godfather: Part III is flawed and it is good. With the release of The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone I revisited the theatrical cut. Since its release Godfather: Part III has been viewed as the stepchild of the franchise, being a disappointment. When compared to its predecessors it absolutely is disappointing.

8835  Look I never understood why this movie was hated. Despite all the glamour and awards; this movie always had a sort of witch hunt "let's kill it" vibe by so many people. I agree with two things: one Sophia Copolla's acting is bad and two it's nowhere as good as the first two.But here is the thing, it was never meant to be as good as those first two movies. And watching it on its own; its a good‚Ä¶

Muy inferior a las anteriores pero tiene un prop√≥sito honesto de mostrar las consecuencias de la culpa y el remordimiento. Aunque The Irishman lo hizo muchisimo mejor. 
8837  The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael CorleoneThe original cut of the Godfather III never deserved the vitriol it got, but it does have its faults. The major problem for me is that the Andy Garcia crime arc is too separate from the Vatican politics arc and the movie gets bogged down in the latter. This fault is fixed in the new cut. The Vatican political machinations are trimmed down to a minimum and the focus of the movie‚Ä¶

8847  Watched for the first time, as Coppola‚Äôs new cut, The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone.As Coppola and Pacino have been saying in all of their interviews for this- this movie was always intended to be an epilogue. Never a Part 3. Always an epilogue. It‚Äôs about Michael getting out of the biz because he‚Äôs guilty for all of his sins. In that way and many others it‚Äôs kind of rebelling against the first 2 movies, which are‚Ä¶  
8848  The Godfather: Part III, em alguns momentos, parece um grande fan service para os aficionados pelos dois primeiros filmes - talvez, por causa disso, Coppola o considere mais como um ep√≠logo do que como uma sequ√™ncia direta e relevante. Praticamente todas as cenas marcantes dos longas de 1972 e 1974 s√£o de alguma forma referenciadas aqui: a abertura com uma festa, uma tentativa de assassinato ao Don Corleone, a investiga√ß√£o dos respons√°veis por esse assassinato, conspira√ß√µes pol√≠ticas e econ√¥micas, a‚Ä¶

8850 THE GODFATHER, CODA: THE DEATH OF MICHAEL CORLEONEThe Godfather, Part III walked so that The Irishman could run. 
8851 Obviously not as good as the other two. It‚Äôs basically a remake of the first film, except worse. I didn‚Äôt hate this, as it‚Äôs easy to just imagine it doesn‚Äôt exist, but it‚Äôs just so pointless. Other than the money, what the fuck was the point of making this? And don‚Äôt even get me started on the romance between two first-cousins that literally say ‚ÄúI love you cousin‚Äù before sucking each other‚Äôs faces.I guess it‚Äôs worth saying that I‚Äôve finally seen all The Godfather films on the big screen! Definitely more engrossing and enjoyable than on my TV. 
8852 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  im only halfway thru this but wwhy the fuck is there a weird incest plotline like arent mary and vinnie literally blood related wh at the fuck its making me ü§¢edit: finished it. see baby that wouldn't have happened if you hadn't fucked your cousin  
8853 THE GODFATHER, CODA: THE DEATH OF MICHAEL CORLEONE.Logging the original cut of the film as currently the actual entry seems to be a 90 minute documentary with no crew.So this version is half an hour shorter but still drags on way too long. And honestly, I don't think an even shorter cut would help. There's some very good stuff here, especially in the first two thirds of the movie, but I still find the final third chronic.It's worth a watch if you're curious but don't expect your opinion to change much on it.

8855 Ning√∫n problema en reconocer que se me ha saltado una lagrima con la canci√≥n de Apolonia. 
8856 I actually preferred the original cut, but it‚Äôs still a great film. Never understood the bad rep it gets. 
8857  The Coda/Directors cut/final cut/super extreme charged cut/thingyThe way Garcia says "Zaza" after he shoots him is god-tier.¬†The first act is.. whatever. Some good stuff, little bit too much Sofia, you‚Äôre either on board with the Zaza stuff or not, but once this film goes to Sicily, I think it absolutely ramps up and we get some classic Godfather imagery.¬†I love that we get some Michael and Kay scenes of them just.. hanging out.¬†This wraps up Michael‚Äôs‚Ä¶  
8858 It insists upon itself, Lois. 
8859  I have seen Parts I and II but I have never seen The Godfather, Part III and I'm not sure I even want to after seeing Coda. If there are people saying this recut isn't all that different from the original then it's my view that this film has been judged too harshly over the years. Maybe it's because I had the privilege of being able to see this on the big screen in my favourite theatre in the world‚Ä¶  
8860  I have never seen The Godfather Part III. I have seen, and very much enjoyed the previous 2 parts, but for whatever reason I was never able to get into part 3 past around the 20 minute mark. Now that I was practically forced to sit and watch it (or I should say the directorially refined version of the film formally, or theatrically, known as The Godfather Part III), I am here to say that I enjoyed it. It was‚Ä¶  
8861 Similar to Apocalypse Redux, Coda slightly enhances and refines an good movie. Sofia Coppola‚Äôs performance is still distracting in moments but her death felt more impactful with this new cut. By removing Part III from the title, now with Coda, this movie can exist as an epilogue to The Godfather and The Godfather Part II. 
8862 Went and saw the Coda version. Oh boy, that was a big oof. I cannot imagine how the original version was. 
8863  It's no secret that the original cut of The Godfather part 3 received a luke-warm reception at best, as far as disappointing sequels go, it's become rather notorious, the go to for many.I myself have always maintained that Part 3 is not a bad film, it's just okay, disappointing by comparison to it's remarkable predecessors, but far from the worst film I have seen when standing on it's own two feet. There have always been rumours that it wasn't‚Ä¶  
8864 REVIEW FOR: THE GODFATHER CODA: THE DEATH OF MICHAEL CORLEONE.Went to watch it with my dad. Ate a burger before. Ate a chocolate after. It was cool. Honestly? A better cut... or at least I did manage to apreciatte more what Coppola wanted to do with this one, not a closing to a trilogy, but an epilogue to a duology. The new title and ending are both mayor improvements, tge film as a whole still suffers a lot from the issues the original cut does as well. 
8865 My review of the 2020 coda recut is that I tried the new fudge dark chocolate m&m's at the theatre. They were pretty good but unsurprisingly quite rich and I was only able to get through 75% of the bag. A good effort nonetheless. 
8866 Review for Coda Version: Stick with the original cut, it's much better. 
8867 I always really liked The Godfather Part III as an epilogue to the saga. This new "Coda" cut is my first time re-watching after about 7 years. Not sure what's different about it other than maybe feeling a bit tighter in the editing? Whatever the changes are, I just hope it means people will quit ragging on the movie so much 
8868 The death of Michael Corleone I swear I'll never ever allow any bad reviews restring me from watching any movie whatsoever. A solid addition to the franchise that his first 2 movies are almost perfect and nearly unreachable. 
8869 ‚Ä¶‚ÄúDon‚Äôt overestimate the power of forgiveness.‚Äù‚Ä¶ 
8870  ‚ÄúYou all know Joey Zasa. He is, I admit, an important man. His picture is on the cover of the New York Times magazine. He gets the Esquire magazine award, for the best-dressed gangster! The newspapers praise him, because, he hires Blacks into his family, which shows he has a good heart. He, is famous. Who knows? Maybe one day, he will make all of you, popular.‚ÄùThe Godfather, Part III has a number of major problems. Some of them‚Ä¶  
8871 Edit: this is a review of Mario Puzo‚Äôs The Godfather Coda, The Death of Michael Corleone.Not much is different from the theatrical version, some scenes are cut and the beginning and end have been slightly changed.Can we all agree Sophia isn‚Äôt that bad, like not good or anything but not as terrible as everyone made her performance up to be.Just wished the ending was better, not much is really different.Also every time Joe Mantegna appeared I couldn't help but think of his performance in Baby‚Äôs Day Out. 
8872 This is a capsule about The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael CorleoneWouldn't exactly classify this as a corrective to the original cut, but it definitely smooths some of the rougher edges. Particularly the Vincent/Mary relationship, which has been rightfully criticized vehemently over the years. Mary is still an underwritten role, but she's more posited here as the result of Michael's failures rather than his ignorance. Plus, the film becomes less about class and financial ascension and more about irredeemable moral rot. Fun! 
8873 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  People call this the bad one? While I agree it‚Äôs easily the worst, it‚Äôs still really great. Al Pacino was fantastic throughout especially at the ending. Speaking of which, this ending was fantastic. One of the most satisfying endings I‚Äôve seen in a long time and it was very intense and very sad. Vincent while not my favorite, wasn‚Äôt bad and he was portrayed quite nice. This film has a lot of good scenes and lines. Michaels death was perfect. No lines, no year, nothing. Just him. Dying peaceful in I‚Äôm guess Sicily. I noticed he kinda died in a similar way to his father.  
8874  Ok I‚Äôm going to say it. Sophia Coppola‚Äôs performance isn‚Äôt that bad. It‚Äôs certainly not bad enough to drag the film down any. It‚Äôs a pretty bad performance sure, but keep in mind she‚Äôs lumbered with the absolute worst dialogue in the film. She has to act out an incest plot line which isn‚Äôt even treated as slightly weird by the film but is definitely weird. She has to repeatedly call a man whose also giving a bad performance ‚Äúcous‚Äù‚Ä¶

8877 listen, this movie is good. some parts are even great. the entire opera/killing sequence is right up there with the godfather¬†part 1 and 2. this movie simply had the misfortune of having to follow two of the greatest movies ever made. 
8878  Looking back, I was definitely too harsh on this the first time round. In all honesty, The Godfather: Part III really isn‚Äôt that bad, it‚Äôs just not nearly as good as the first two. It looks atrocious by its association with the two literal masterpieces that preceded it but it‚Äôs not bad, just mediocre. Sofia Coppola is by far and away the worst part of the film. Francis Ford Coppola just cannot seem to understand that, just because she‚Äôs related‚Ä¶  
8879  Scavenger Hunt 68 - Task 12. Watch a sequel "Just when I thought I was out... they pull me back in"The Godfather: Part III is a polemic film, it's sorrounded by controversial opinions from some people that found this to be a disrespectful with the masterpieces of the 70s and others that actually find this an amazing conclusion that even not being in the same level, honor the legacy of these classicsBut overall, the amount of people just‚Ä¶  
8880 it‚Äôs not as good as the first two but it‚Äôs not awful. it has its flaws but it‚Äôs a good enough movie. i think it suffers from that thing where the first two were three hours long so they felt that this one had to be that long as well when they clearly didn‚Äôt have the material for a good three hour movie. so it drags a bit in spots. but the parts that shine are really great. i‚Äôm interested to see Coppola‚Äôs new cut of the movie and how it compares to this one. i can‚Äôt imagine trimming it down can make it any worse. 
8881 "The sarcastic correlation of religion and mob power that informs the series from the start, the aspect of funerary rite that defines the climax of the first film and the subsuming of the role of giver of life and death by the Dons, here gives way to a more urgent questioning of just what if anything a man like Michael can ask of his nominal faith, and whether redemption, both worldly and spiritual, is possible for him."Full review at Film Freedonia:filmfreedonia.com/2019/02/23/the-godfather-1972-the-godfather-part-ii-1974-the-godfather-part-iii-1990/ 
8882 Coppola encerra com maestria a hist√≥ria da fam√≠lia Corleone, com um misto de melancolia e saudosismo. Um digno final para um Michael que busca acima de tudo a reden√ß√£o.E n√£o, a Sofia Coppola n√£o √© t√£o ruim assim. 
8883 Was very weird seeing my stupid ex-boss‚Äôs name in the credits. 
8884 ‚ÄúNo one man should have all that power‚Äù - Kanye West 
8885 Sure, it's not quite on the same level as the first two, and I understand why some view this as a lackluster conclusion to what is now a legendary saga. That said, this is a good movie. It's consistently engaging, well-directed, and Pacino absolutely kills it here, in what I'd argue is his best performance in the entire trilogy. So, yeah, The Godfather: Part III is good, actually.

Hell the second one being as good as it was, was a miracle.This movie does have its problems - one particular plotline is so...obscene. The direction isn't that great at times and neither is the writing. The performance from Sofia Coppola is mediocre, awful even.But this movie can be really good at times,‚Ä¶

8893  Not as intelligently rendered or patient as the previous two films. Still, everything post-Joey Zasa is involving. The confession scene with Michael and Cardinal Lamberto is the best scene by a mile. Wallach is a ham and irritating to watch. Sofia Coppola's voice wrecks the performance more than anything. George Hamilton?? Come on. Still, Andy Garcia is powerful as Vincent. You just wish he had more to do. And Keaton and Shire have some great moments. In the end. I‚Ä¶  
8894 Best of out the trilogy! 
8895 While not as great as the first two it‚Äôs still a good movie. Sofia Coppola‚Äôs performance wasn‚Äôt as awful as I thought but it wasn‚Äôt that good especially during her last scene...yikes. I looked up some bts info which confirms my suspicion that the script was rushed and the character of Tom Hagan was supposed to be in it but the studio didn‚Äôt want to pay Duvall what he asked for which was an issue with many other actors who were going to be in this during the troubled production. 
8896 lol 
8897  It is such a colossal mess that on the top of my head I can just think about some things.Sofia Coppola's performance is atrocious but kind of unintentially hilarious.It's so poorly structured with characters making dumb choices every five minutes.

Over long, a little tedious, a bad Sofia Coppola performance, and it barely even feels like The Godfather at times.But also, it's beautifully designed, gorgeously shot, entertaining in bursts, and features some excellent performances.It's a perfectly decent film, but anything next to the first film is a disappointment (hell, I think the second film was a disappointment personally, and‚Ä¶

8907  Maybe I went in with extremely low expectations, but I liked this quite a bit. Obviously it doesn't even begin to match the level of quality of the other two, and you can't even think about this one without the other ones in the same breath.

8909  No creo que el problema del The Godfather Part III sea el alejarse de la mafia y acercarse m√°s a lo l√≠cito. Al contrario, dir√≠a que es acierto. Es lo que Vito buscaba desde el momento cero. No obstante, falla en tantas cosas. Algunas incluso rid√≠culas y que no me explico por qu√© suceden.

8914  Francis Ford coppla made two of the best films of all time so it was a herculean task to end the trilogy with a bang. There was so much promise with the return of the original cast and crew. Unfortunately the final installment in the trilogy ended up being a disappointment. Al Pachino is still good as always and the directorial efforts from Coppla are still visually extravagant. The writing however took a turn for the worse with the stakes‚Ä¶  
8915 Oh yeah and there‚Äôs this one. What laugh this was. Not bad but not good.¬†More thoughts on this one in the video. 
8916  It's really not a bad flick! People complain about the casting of Sofia Coppola but honestly... I respect the big guy for casting his own daughter in an incest subplot followed by her murder. It's such a tasteless move that I found it quite funny.The set pieces that prop up each act are still worth the price of admission to this day.

8922 Coppola‚Äôs direction and the performances, say for his daughter who is dreadful to watch, are really solid.

8925 Really not as awful as I was lead to believe 
8926 6.4/10 
8927 I love the Godfather films, I really do, but this just fell short of the others. It wasn't as exciting or fun to watch and I didn't feel like I was witnessing anything great like I did with the first one. I felt like there were plot lines wrote in to add drama to the story but the only reason why, was because they knew they were repeating what they have done before in the first two films and needed to bring in something new so it wasn't just a copy of the greats. 
8928 I Slumped over in my chair like Pacino when it was over.¬†Also I was so grossed out by the cousins fingering the tortellinis together.¬†It just is so disjointed from the other two.

8940 Ojo, no es mala, pero pasaron 16 a√±os y eso se nota en la forma de Al Pacino y la producci√≥n de la pel√≠cula, distinta a las anterioresPodr√≠a haber terminado en la pel√≠cula anterior y era el final perfectoIgual, la escena de la √≥pera y las escaleras >>>pd la manera en la que rankee est√° trilog√≠a me hace pensar que no tengo criterio alguno 
8941  Okay I‚Äôm taking a deep breath. This movie is not nearly as bad as people say. In fact I would venture to say it‚Äôs actually very good. Its main problem is that when you compare it with the other two Godfathers, it‚Äôs like comparing a three star Michelin dish with your own home cooking, no matter how good it is. The story is actually pretty good. The Pacino and Keaton scenes are especially on form. It‚Äôs still beautifully shot and‚Ä¶  
8942  This is the ‚ÄúAl Pacino and Andy Garcia movie‚Äù(and not a good one)I finally finished The Godfather trilogy and in my opinion, this movie (much like Shrek 3) should not exist. It adds nothing to the story and if the plan was to show him old and the future of the family, I feel like that subject could‚Äôve been tackled in the second movie in a Scorsese type way.¬†You feel no connection to the characters (not even the‚Ä¶

8944  Francis Ford Coppola RankedWhose fucking idea was it to give Michael fucking Corleone diabetes? The man who killed Virgil Solozzo, orchestrated the takedown of the most powerful men in the mafia, outwitted Hyman Roth, and held control over and grew the most powerful mafia family in the world does not have fucking diabetes. And he especially doesn't cry about regretting any of those things to a priest.Holy FUCKING Christ this is a bastard of a film. It's poorly‚Ä¶  
8945 Un peu en dessous des deux premiers √† cause du manque de personnages forts, mais une belle conclusion. Le personnage de Michael Corleone est pouss√© au bout de sa logique, permettant d'achever le traitement des questionnements de la trilogie. La s√©quence finale est un v√©ritable d√©chirement, touchant au sublime.

8947 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Guys, it's not THAT bad. Don't get me wrong, it's not great either and it should have been so much better, but it's not awful. I will admit that I just didn't care about most of what was going on in this though. I don't give a shit about the plot to kill the pope, I don't give a shit about the Carleone incest, and I don't give a shit about Uncle Mike's diabetes.  
8948 this took me awhile to finish and i know most people have it but overall i thought it was really interesting and it put a good end to the trilogy. it‚Äôs not even close to as good as the others.

8951  After my controversial thoughts on The Godfather: Part II, a film I still really liked as indicated here, I think most fans of this saga will be okay with me seeing this as the lesser of the three films in this saga. Although, I think it might even be lesser Francis Ford Coppola as well.I do like what Francis Ford Coppola is trying to do here, turning a much older Michael into more of a splitting image of his‚Ä¶

8954 This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Wow, sharks have definitely been jumped here. Of course, Al Pacino's performance is fantastic, just as it was in the two movies before, but the only other positive aspect I could point out would be that this movie felt a lot more focused than Part II. It told its story in a straightforward way and didn't have to play with unnecessary time jumps to make everything needlessly complicated. Other than that, there really isn't anything worth praising here. Enough has‚Ä¶

8957 Not bad - maybe even good! I liked it more than I expected, even with its flaws (Sofia...is not great but really isn‚Äôt that bad). I always love old haunted Al, and he does a good job of bringing this new version of Michael to the screen. Nice to see Silvio Dante's favorite line acted out. Still a bit jarring to hear an Elvis Costello song in this. 
8958 On the final years of a mafioso, The Irishman was subtler and better, but this is still a very good movie. I didn‚Äôt know Andy Garcia could be hot.

This film just wasn‚Äôt as good as it should have been. It was entertaining don‚Äôt get me wrong. Pacino was great as usual.

8963  The Godfather part 3 is by far the low point in the trilogy. Whilst part two feels like it exists as part of the original, telling one story with two halves, this feels like a tacked on sequel. Which apparently it was as Coppola made no plans to make a third film. Michael‚Äôs arc feels complete at the end of the second film. We see him go from likeable and down to earth to a cold hearted gangster. His arc‚Ä¶

8969 Nearly put me to sleep. Pointless third addition. 
8970  What a drag. Slack and uninvolving where the first two were engrossing, explicit where they were subtle, goofy and over-the-top where they were sober (a helicopter driveby? What is this, fucking Grand Theft Auto?). I don't think I'm being unfair comparing it to them, either, because this movie practically begs the viewer to do exactly that. Even the opera scene, unquestionably the movie's peak, is basically just there to remind you of the baptism from the original. I'll defend Sofia‚Ä¶  
8971  Legitimately awful. I could not have expected this in my wildest nightmares. Everyone knows Sofia Coppola's performance is TERRIBLE, but once again it's worse than I thought it could be, and the rest of the cast (bar Al Pacino and Andy Garcia) cannot deliver any of the atrocious dialogue either! Everything that comes out of these cardboard cutout "character"s mouths is expository and repetitive. There are constant shouts of "you're my enemy!" or "we sure are in [insert name of‚Ä¶  
8972 look i'm not saying i condone incest, i'm just saying that, in this case, i understand it 
8973  Uh, alright? I was actually ready to love this based on the opening scene. I was excited! It was cool to see Michael Corleone so far¬†in his career, and his kids grown up. I was thinking, ‚ÄúOkay! This isn‚Äôt bad. It‚Äôs got the charm of the first two still.‚Äù But that all disappears at some point within the first act. This was an extremely mixed bag. Compared to the other masterful films, this just feels kind of lazy and messy.‚Ä¶  
8974 Severely okay. Hard to top the first two masterpieces. Incest is bad mkay 
8975 This is missing the same passion and artistry of the Corleone family we know. 
8976  Vamos a ver. Es curioso que de las tres pel√≠culas que conforman la trilog√≠a, esta sea de la que m√°s cosas tenga que decir. Supongo que porque las dos primeras me dejan sin palabras. Que "El Padrino: Parte III" es la peor de la saga no es ninguna novedad, no obstante, sigue siendo un producto notable.

8980 I wish this would have been made closer to the other ones. the aesthetic of this one just feels so much more, sterile? i miss the grit of the 1970‚Äôs film and sound and lighting. also there‚Äôs a lot of violence that really doesn‚Äôt help the story progress. I liked the idea of seeing what Michael had done to the family in their later years tho. 
8981 Yeah this was so much less engaging than the first two?? And I know why Sofia directs instead of acts. The over the top violence really betrayed the first two as well. At least I know what this ones like now 
8982 Puede quedar opacada y ,hasta en muchos casos, ser menospreciada en comparaci√≥n a sus 2 predecesoras, pero El Padrino III es una obra tan completa y compleja que cada vez que se se vuelve a revisar se le siguen encontrando cosas nuevas, se le sigue sacando jugo (de naranja) a una obra compleja y completa. Desde religi√≥n y pol√≠tica internacional, historia de la humanidad hasta conflictos personales, familiares e intrafamiliares.Masterpiece 
8983 In a league of it's own, if we compare it with first two parts. Unfortunately for everyone, it's bushleague. 
8984 Strip away the style, engaging story, genius character development, iconic acting and powerful emotions from the first two Godfather movies and you're left with a generic gangster film, only really pretentious.

That is just a testament to how big a joke that sorry excuse for a ‚Äúprice‚Äù is.

8990 Look how they massacred my seminal epic crime saga 
8991  ‚ÄúPolitics and crime. They‚Äôre the same thing.‚ÄùOk, so I think I've said this on the podcast but might as well write it here. This movie is not bad. The worst thing about it is that it is the sequel to two of the ten/twenty or so best films ever made. The Oscar-nominated Andy Garcia performance is incredible. Coppola's indictment of the Catholic Church is *chef's kiss.* Sofia Coppola, thought certainly subpar, is nowhere near as bad as history has‚Ä¶  
8992 I'm gonna try to drink away my memories of this film and i'm curious if Coppola did the same 
8993  Well on a bright side, it's not as bad as I remembered it.For starters, on this second viewing I have to concede that the infamous helicopter scene and the 'hit at the parade scene' made sense thematically, although logistically speaking it would be nigh impossible. However on this second viewing I also recognize that the writing and acting were downright atrocious. All subtlety were thrown out of the window in favor of spectacles or catchy catchphrases. And I'm not‚Ä¶  
8994 I mean yeah there's incest in this but damn it still slaps 
8995  Imagine being a sequel to the best film ever made. Imagine being the sequel of the best sequel ever made. This is what THE GODFATHER PART 3 tries to do 16 years later. For all the backlash, G3 is probably the best hated movie ever made. There seems to be confusion as to why people hate it so much. I feel that maybe it's hated because of word of mouth; We are supposed to hate it!Well, I love it!‚Ä¶  
8996 one taught me love,one taught me patience,and one taught me pain.guess what this one is 
8997 Not as bad as people say it is. I found it to be great on its own, the story is intriguing it‚Äôs shot damn well, and the performances are pretty solid (Save for a few.)It‚Äôs only tarnished when put up against the juggernauts that are the first two entries in the trilogy.¬†Sofia Coppola is still the love of my life, I have no regrets. 
8998  Although I have seen Parts 1 and 2 numerous times over the decades, I had never watched Part 3. The conventional wisdom is that it‚Äôs an inferior movie and unworthy of the first two. But I recently decided to put myself through the 9-hour task of watching all three in order (thankfully not in one sitting), and quickly came to the conclusion that the conventional wisdom is correct. Much has been said of the poor performance by Sophia, but the‚Ä¶

It wasn‚Äôt painful to watch, but some scenes were definitely laughable. It feels like an entirely different person‚Ä¶
